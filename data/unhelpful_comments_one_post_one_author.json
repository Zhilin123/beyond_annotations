That\u2019s why I had suggested it, I had to shop around until I found one that was intelligent enough and could handle my loud, outspoken, and in your face personality that I often have.\n\n\nAnd although annoying, committing to the search proved to be worthy for me, as I was actually able to find someone who worked well for me. Another option for you to consider is digital therapy sessions. You can now have full on Skype-type sessions in the privacy of your own bedroom. You can do a little research on that.\n\nEven if you cannot drive, nor fully exercise, you certainly can create a custom routine for yourself to do Every morning to start your day off. Only YOU know your physical limitations, so you have to actually Manage yourself here. Know when to push yourself, know when to dial it back, but it is YOU that has to make this happen for yourself.\n\n\nIt could be something that requires no tools. Maybe it\u2019s push ups, sit ups, and air squats. Maybe it\u2019s burpees. Whatever your limitation, since you are the Master of knowing what you can and cannot do, you now can empower yourself to do what you Know you can do.\n\nIf you truly are That limited physically, than applying for disability seems like a real option for you.\n\n\nI tend to believe the old adage that goes: \u201cIf you say you can\u2019t. Then you can\u2019t\u201d.\n\n\nWhich is more about telling yourself what is possible, and how those thoughts become reality if that\u2019s what you allow them to do. \n\nSo if you choose to hold onto this Theme, which from my perspective sounds a little bit like a \u201cpitty party/I am the eternally fucked victim\u201d mentality. Then, that\u2019s Exactly what you\u2019ll produce in life.\n\n\nI say this because I want you to know that it\u2019s Real. So it becomes imperative that you change your perception. Attitude reflects altitude.\n\nThere are literally people who have had both arms and legs amputated, going around the world, being motivational speakers and the like, yet you let your issues confound you.\n\n\nI want to encourage you by telling you to never give up. Look for the silver lining. Perhaps spending so much of your life suffering has meaning somewhere in it. Maybe, because you understand the depth of pain and suffering, you would be able to guide others out of it yourself.\n\n\nMaybe you\u2019d make an excellent therapist one day, or psychologist.\n\n\nBut it all starts with working on you. \u201cIf you want to change the world, begin with cleaning your bedroom.\u201d\n\n\nIt means, you have no right to try to attempt to fix the world when your own house isn\u2019t in order. And I mean that not as a slight, but a reality. What\u2019s fascinating is that this has the added benefit of making the world a better place. If Every person focused on working on themselves, rather than trying to influence the world, the world would be a better place.\n\n\nSo start with you. I still think you have a lot of options, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve explored them all.\n\n\nWhen you say therapy doesn\u2019t work, how many different therapists have you seen? I think suggesting selling bracelets and such online is a silly idea. Obviously, you have the intellect and passion to do something, however you are inhibited by your traumatic experiences. \n\n\nSo, I really think the first challenge is addressing that. I don\u2019t think exercise literally cures anyone. But I do believe, that if you can participate in a very intense exercise program, a program so intense that at the end of it, you are almost throwing up, laying on your back gasping for air, Every.single.time. Then, and Only then, could you illicit a response where post workout, you have this sense that the intensity of the work out was sooooo intense, that for a moment, it seems to have turned down the Volume of your other issues, even if temporarily.\n\n\nI think THIS, is the benefit of exercise. I also think intent is important. I had a pretty traumatic life as well. And I Still struggle with those thoughts and feelings. The Difference is, I am so much better at identifying those feelings, and Doing something about it.\n\n\nI do not like violence. I don\u2019t like fighting, and I would never consider myself an athlete or anything like that, in fact, I\u2019m more of a nerd. And so, I FORCE myself multiple times a week to train Jiu Jitsu, and seriously fight grown men.\n\nI do so, because Jiu Jitsu provides me a path. It\u2019s very difficult to explain, but essentially, it\u2019s metaphorical for all the adversity in life that one could experience. It teaches me to maneuver and work with it. It teaches me patience and humility. It turns down the volume to my problems, and makes me a better human being. I really believe this, and if you don\u2019t believe it, I highly recommend you try it.\n\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not removing my trauma, but it helps me understand it, accept it, digest it, and be okay with it. When people cut me off in traffic, if I had fought that day, I smile and it doesn\u2019t bother me in the slightest, which is the opposite if I haven\u2019t trained.\n\n\nThe next thing is that you need a focus in your life. Happiness comes from MEANING. And the way you attain MEANING in your life is by giving yourself RESPONSIBILITY. \n\n\nSo, to accept Ultimate responsibility, is to attain Ultimate Meaning. Then who cares if your life is tainted with tragedy, or even predicated on it, it becomes WORTH IT!\n\n\nYou can ask most mothers about this. And if you take care of something Outside of you, then you can attain it also. Do you have a dog? Maybe adopting a rescue could be that thing for you.\n\n\nNietzche said, \u201cHe who has a WHY to live for, can bear almost any HOW.\u201d\n\n\nAnd this is exactly what he meant. Living for yourself isn\u2019t enough.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the psychology and philosophy of this, there is a book called \u201cMan\u2019s Search For Meaning\u201d by Viktor Frankl.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not some silly self help book, it\u2019s about Viktor Frankl\u2019s life story, as a psychiatric who was imprisoned as Jew in a the famous Auschwitz nazi prison. \n\n\nIt was there he watched much suffering, watched his friends die, watched all humanity crumble to shit, as the worst of humans came out in such barbarism. He experienced all of this loss, weighed 90 lbs when he left, and learned his wife was also gassed the first few weeks they arrived.\n\n\nThe book is about How in the hell a person can learn to pick up the pieces and attempt to start life over, after having gone through something so horrifying and losing everything and everyone he knew in the process.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lesson to be learned about the human condition, and suffering.  Worth a read.\n\n\nLastly, if cannabis doesn\u2019t help you, there are new studies regarding magic mushrooms and MDMA that are remarkable. Up to you if you wish to explore that path.\n\n\nMy opinion is we cannot change the past, we can only accept it and control TODAY. \n\n\nIt takes everyone very different paths. And it\u2019s usually not a straight line, but I wouldn\u2019t give up.\n\nHow old are you now?", "One of the better suggestions I've heard for this for people who have this problem - it's actually not that uncommon! - is to schedule food.

When I started applying for a new job, I did feel a due sense of guilt over leaving. I also knew that leaving would cause a due level of chaos.\n\nI coped by reminding myself of these facts.\n\nBeing dependable doesn't equate 100% availability ad infinitum. Employers know full well that employees can fall away at any time. Not just by leaving for other pastures, but also because of changing life conditions (choosing to care for family or moving to a different place or country), or, worst, because employees fall seriously ill or die in accidents. That happens too, sadly.\n\nSince any functional organization can only exist by the grace of employees sticking it out for the long haul, employers have an incentive to ensure that employees stay. And even be healthy (make no mistake, that fitness gym isn't there for sheer altruistic reasons). However, caring is expensive, and so many employers will try to do so as cheaply as possible. For one, making vague promises about \"career possibilities\" or \"changes in responsibilities\" are very cheap tools to keep employees motivated. Of course, the problem is that an employer has to come across the bridge at some point.\n\nAt it's core, the entire relationship between you and your boss hinges on the fact that it's a business deal first and foremost. You are there, selling your expertise and time in exchange for a fixed monthly salary. Anything else is circumstantial and sweetens the deal on both ends.\n\nFor instance, an employer may ensure that your workplace is fun, engaging and interesting. The benefit to them is that you'd stick it out for another 6 months to a year. Someone who knows the ropes and is well versed in company culture, is someone who doesn't need training and who is productive.\n\nAs far as an employer is concerned, employees are actually liabilities and hiring them means taking a ton of risks. When you leave, your absence is - above all - a big inconvenience to them as far as business is concerned. At the end of the day, literally everyone - up to and including the pope - is replaceable.\n\nFinally, let's not forget that your employer can and will fire you as soon as your salary turns into a expense that they can't afford anymore. \n\nSo, reminding myself of those facts helped me reduce anxiety and guilt over leaving. \n\nAs for the actual leaving part itself, the best tip I can give you is to prep accordingly for your employer:\n\n* Document all your work\n* Archive all your correspondence\n* Do a formal hand over, and notify all stakeholders\n* Be friendly and cordial at all times.\n* Organise goodbye event like a small reception, or go for dinner with your coworkers.", "&gt;The kitten has been doing it pretty much from the beginning, though.\n\nSo?

Be yourself. I know this sounds generic and even I struggle with it sometimes, but yeah. Be yourself, the best version of yourself. Otherwise, how are you going to meet individuals most similar to you, how are you going to get along and meet people that have your best interests in mind? \n\nBeing yourself also enables people to get to know you and for you to be the most interesting you can be, after all everyone else is already taken, there is only one you, and you are unique and interesting already!! Who knows, you could bring diverse perspectives to the table. You never know unless you get out there and be 100% you. \n\nSecondly. Be open minded, in all ways and forms. Sure, you should try to be friends with people like you, but who ever said it was wrong to be friends with individuals who challenge your views and make you think outside the box? Who said it's wrong to go talk to that cool-looking girl or guy who may seem intimidating, but could possibly be your best friend? So be open-minded, don't let fear and doubt get the best of you. \n\nIf it does, maybe start by talking to the person in the corner who looks like they need friends or could be going through something. I get talking to people who seem 'intimidating' or a lot more 'sociable' might be a bit much if you're not completely exposed to socializing a lot and is still even a lot for me!! (haha social awkwardness? I relate a lot of the time!) \n\nThird. Remember this is a thing all humans have to do. You're not alone! Everyone starts somewhere, am I right? Social butterflies at one point didn't have friends. They had to make them. They had to put themselves out there. So do you :) So if you think people will judge, the most likely thing is they won't.

But like so many have said, it is challenging to not develop feelings...\n\nAnd, well, slowly but surely I did start crushing on her. At first, I started noticing things I didn't pay attention to before. I started seeing her more as a woman, and well, you get the idea. Merely being around her brightened my day well beyond that of a friend. When she was gone, even a few days, I genuinely missed her. It ruined me. Eventually I became so infatuated that I would lose sleep because of the dilemma. I would constantly wonder if she felt the same. \n\nI'd do everything you can think of to try and find any clues, and hints, and hard evidence of ANYTHING pertaining to me in a romantic context. And to be honest, I did derive that she had at least toyed with the idea, but it was very neutral. That is literally all I gleaned. Without saying too much, I still didn't like my odds. I mean, it was so hard to give her a hug, but want to truly hold her. It downright painful to be close to her and not take her by the hand, or see her beautiful smile and not be able to kiss her. All I wanted was a green light.\n\nI had a lot of time to think about what I should do. I was terrified about potentially losing her as a friend. But I could not bear to feel this way forever and not take the chance. After all, you miss every shot you don't take. The worst thing that could happen is that she says no. Well that, and the losing my best friend thing. But the conclusion I came to was that if I confessed and it ruined our friendship, then her feelings about our friendship were shallow. \n\nThat said, I trusted that we were better friends than that. Not only that, but I was going to be leaving for the Air Force and I knew if I left, let time just move on without ever saying anything, I could end up regretting it. And honestly, I WOULD regret it. The torture of always wondering if I made the right choice, wondering whether or not she felt the same and.. just walking away without ever knowing? I couldn't do that. \n\nIn the end, I did end up confessing. And, well, I got turned down. I thought it was about a 50/50 shot, and I prepared myself for the worst, but I told myself I'd rather tell her how I felt and get turned down than live without ever taking the chance. And you know, it hurt. It hurt like hell. I wish it on nobody. To be honest, I sincerely would not recommend trying to be friends with the opposite sex. \n\nYou can be the kind of friends that are just basic. Better than an aquaintence, but you guys aren't coming to each other's houses or hanging out often. You know the type. No, close friends and especially best friends are basically couples without the romantic elements. It's too close. Do not recommend. Good luck if you try. I thought it'd be fine just like countless before me, and I was wrong. Hell, I don't know how she managed it. That might sound egotistical, but this stuff is pretty universal. She is cut from some kind of outlier cloth... And a half. God how I wished she'd feel the same.\n\nAll that being said, I want you to know that you aren't alone in this and I know your pain. I still live with it. Parts of it get easier as you accept it, but other things come up. For example, I am struggling with the fact that I am leaving extremely soon to basic and then I will be gone for a long time for training. But the worst part is that I know she is interested in other guys. She has outright told me about one she is actively pursuing. I never knew words could cut me so deep. It hadn't even been three months after I confessed and she told me she wasn't interested in trying for a boyfriend, period.\n\nThe thought that some other guy might be with the woman I love, and knowing there is nothing I can do about it... Knowing I would probably meet that guy, probably attend her wedding, meet her children, etc. Knowing I would never be the man in her life, there are no words to describe that kind of pain.\n\nTake it from me, if I could turn it off, I would. I think my going to the Air Force is for the best in the long term. I'll get time to reevaluate my life and have a chance to move on in my own way. She is sad that I am going, and so am I, but the life I wanted wasn't going to happen. I tried. Part of me still dreams of a day that she may want to pursue it, but I have to find a way to move on and be happy. And so do you.\n\nMy advice is this: Do not cut contact 100%. Having her in your life is a beautiful thing. You will learn to walk the line, and be close without crossing it. But you should distance yourself AND TELL HER WHY YOU'RE DOING IT. Be honest and say that you need time to fall out of love (or work through your feelings) for her. Be sincere. If done right, she should understand and it should be quite touching. Now, if you are still around her, it is more difficult, and honestly, these kind of feelings don't just go away like that, even with a lot of time. You'll always be at least a little attracted to her. Really what you are doing is burying the feelings...\n\nBe careful about the time you spend together or you can revert a little. For me, I still want her, but I am not hopelessly depressed about it anymore. However, I still get my bad days or course. The main thing is that I can be around her without the pain... I am sure that will change if she gets a boyfriend or things change while I am in the airforce, but it does get easier in general.\n\nTL;DR: Distance yourself for your own sake. Take a good long time (varies, but probably more than a year) to work through this and essentially give up on her romantically. As cruel as it sounds, you'll have to accept that she doesn't see you that way, but others might. But whatever you do, EXPLAIN TO HER WHY YOU ARE DISTANCING YOURSELF. You want to consider the health of your friendship and her feelings too. Sure, she only sees you as her best friend, but those feelings are important too. With how you feel, it's easy to forget that, trust me. It really isn't fair, but you need to be there for her as a friend even if you'll never get YOUR feelings returned. You'll find a way to move on. We all do one way or another. We have no choice, but we all should make the best of it even when it isn't easy... Best of luck, sincerely,\n\nOne who understands all too well.", "Have your son sit at the front of the bus, close to the driver until this is further sorted if he cannot not take the bus", "I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good", "Go for it!", "that\u2019s freaky, i might check with a doctor", "You right I speaking more of values, I honestly respect hitting a hooker more bc atleast you cant get addicted to that.

I am trying to help discourage the idea of humanizing these bad addictive drugs that can hurt OP. I'm not saying ppl shouldnt change their way of life, but when there is evidence that says something is bad we should understand that they are bad and not try to make it feel okay in certain regards. Lol this is sad, I'm not going to argue with your back tracking argumentative mindset bc it is apparent you can listen to reasoning. What worse is that you think she us insult and saying I'm 16 bc I have a different opinion. I'm 25 in medical school in LA, that's why I told you that if you dont know facts you need to keep your mouth shut but it is obvious that you cant read or listen but what to expect from a bias person.\n\nEdit: also racist bc I said prohibition was a failure bc of pride of white ppl, no. First you cant be racist against a dominate racist society you can be discriminate and ignorant but not racist. Two it is factual that it is bc drinking was so integrates into white american culture and that their pride to keep there biggest drug free to their own culture was the reason it is hated. That is why certain drugs are demonized bc they are integrated and originated through Spaniards or whiteness. Prohibition solutions to heavily tax drinking or banning it is not radical it is a logical step to stop it but I guess you dontvficus on logic. Same do image coming from Detroit and going to LA, the amount of drugs and weed that surrounded my life was immense yet I didn't fall to drugs or temptation yet the mental and emotional ramifications from feeling as tho you dont belong extend harsher to other than you and I. I'm simply looking at this through a mental lens, and since OP is asking this question it is obviously having a mental affect on them, so to think of them differently would help OP feel less needy of belonging to them while still treating him like humans and friends. I dislike a lot of people from my middle school, highschool, and college yet none of them knew. They thought that I loved every single one of them so much enough to win the biggest award at the school, but they never knew bc I treated them like humans. You are right about it being on him being influenced but you cant say entirely, the power of peer pressure and need to fit in at a time where ppl are the most vulnerable a part of the value of the ppl around him too. If they pressure OP to do it is it all on OP, no. I say treat them the same but you should look at them differently bc that's a huge change of character values. Lol if you dont know the health problems and characteristic problems of vaping then you need to get over yourself and keep your mouth shut. Last time I checked this was an advice thread not a thread where you need to put in your own personal bias/addiction on to a person who has there own personal hatred for vaping. And yes you are right all those drugs from drinking to smoking are bad but right now vaping is not one that is so integrated into society that it is impossible to stop like said drinking. People talk about weed and vaping bc they are new or foreign ideas that old white people disapprove of. You dont see major news about drinking bc the reforms that we tried like prohibition only caused destruction bc of the pride of white ppl. Now something new comes up that is obviously fucking bad for you from literally all the research, so yes it is better to fight now. When I have someone who is addicted to nicotine saying it is fine bc other drugs, someone having withdrawls bc they lost their vape, someone going out of their way to vape, and someone defending the cancer of vape that is spread to good ppl it is a problem.

I barely studied before tests and my grades got bad. All I cared was gaming. I (and my friends) had no social life. We rarely met in real life and didn't talk to girls. Basically i used gaming to escape the bad reality. After couple of years I moved out with my  family to another country and had to start from 0. I knew nobody. For the first month i had an old computer with no internet. That's was the point  when I realized what have I done with my life, because I couldn't pretent that I had no problems and play video games. I started working on my self and wanted to become the best version of myself. In the first year it was hard to find friends, because i was still learning basics of the language.\n\nHere I am 3 years after I moved out: I go to the gym, I joined the scouts and the voluntary fire department, I made some friends, I go out and party with them, I picked other hobbies like reading (mostly self help) and started learning to play the guitar couple weeks ago. My personality changed a lot: I am more productive than ever, I'm not lazy anymore and I don't just sit there and lose time. I am more confident and think more positively. When Im in a bad mood sometimes I remind myself that it will be better. I'll never stop improving myself and although I changed my lifestyle I'll keep improving myself.\n\nEdit: sorry for this long ass comment (longer than the actual post).

I know Blitz, Seven Card No Peek (there's uh...other names for it that some casinos use but they aren't PC), Poker or 5 Card Draw (the easiest), Pass the Trash, Trash, and Black Jack. The most common ones are Poker and Texas Hold'em but I personally dislike the last one. \n\nBlitz - the goal is to get 31 total with the same suit. This means 1 ace and two face cards or one face card and a ten, of the same suit so hearts, clubs, diamonds, or spades. You can knock if you have something other than 31 and believe you have more points than everyone else. \n\nPoker - Get the best cards of course. You can get a flush which is 5 of the same suit, pairs, three of a kind, a straight which is like 2-3-4-5-6 or a row of correlating numbers. Aces are a high card in this, the highest, so usually a pair of those will allow you to win. \n\nSeven Card No Peek - You are all dealt a stack of 7 cards. There are 3 cards placed in the middle - a kill card which \"kills\" you and you are out, a wild card which can be used like a joker, and a card you have to beat. You want to be the last person in. Person one has to beat the \"to beat\" card, person 2 has to beat person 1 or use all their cards. If they don't beat person 1, then person 3 has to or show all their cards. And so on and so forth until someone is undefeated. You can't see what you're going to draw and the rules of poker apply. It can go from beating a 2 to beating a straight. I've seen people winning with great cards and then they draw the kill card to beat someone and they're out. \n\nBlack Jack - You have 2 cards, one down and one facing up. You want to get close to or at 21 but can't exceed it or you lose. You will say hit if you think you have less than 21 but won't bust. Bust means you go over 21. For instance, say I have an Ace (which in this game can be used as a 1 or 11) but don't know what my other card is. I will say hit and dealer throws me a 5, I'll say I stay. I flip my other card over and it's a 10. So I have 16 which isn't very high, but I haven't busted. If the dealer has less than 16, I win. It's you vs the dealer, not you vs everyone else. All ties to to the dealer. \n\nPass the Trash - Everyone gets 1 card and you do not want the lowest card or you lose. You get 4 chips usually as \"lives\". You don't want the Ace. Ace is a 1 in this game. Anyone with a king automatically faces it up for everyone. Your goal is again to have the highest card. If you feel comfortable that your card can beat everyone else, you can say \"I stay\" but don't say it until it is your turn. If  the person to your right wants to, they can trade cards with you which they will definitely do if they have a crappy card. The goal is to keep the highest card. Whoever loses round 1 keeps the \"trash\" which is the discard pile. \n\nTrash - You all start out with 10 cards face down. I like to do 5 on top, 5 on bottom because it's easier for me. It goes 1(Ace),2,3,4,5 then 6,7,8,9,10. Kings stop your turn, Queens mean draw again, and Jacks are wild cards. Your goal is to have all your cards in order face up before anyone else. This goes on until someone is down to 1 card and gets the Ace (it is a very time consuming game). For every round you clear your cards, you lose a card. So instead of having to find 1 - 10, you go 1-9, then 1-8, and so on. \n\nI know Blitz, Poker, and Seven Card No Peek are played in casinos. I know small town card gamblings have all these games. Again, I've never been in a casino but I have family that definitely has been and we all play cards often.", "Yes it does not mean you\u2019ll start being this incredibly productive human. It just means that now you are important, you\u2019ll start seeing your time as important as well. You have to take action and just start. Start working on something you\u2019ve been pushing away. You become important by simply deciding that you are. It\u2019s all in the mind. You have to decide you are important and carry yourself like you are - because you are important. Do you know how to become important? That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s normal to be afraid you won\u2019t be accepted. When something is a big deal and means a lot to us, we are nervous about failing.

You are fully capable of doing it. You probably don\u2019t want to start because it might get difficult, but once again it\u2019s all about mindset. Start thinking when it gets difficult, this is an opportunity for me to show myself how smart and hardworking I am, to find the solutions and complete it. Struggle is a common part of life. You are being very self aware of your behaviours and thoughts, which is a big step. You should be proud of yourself that you are capable to reflect on yourself. Not many people can do this. You are acknowledging your struggle and trying to change. Be kinder to yourself. Look at how you\u2019re making plans and methods and asking yourself questions - this is not small, don\u2019t dismiss this. Okay, you feel like the results are the same. Do you know who stonecutters are? They hammer at a rocks hundred of times and nothing seems to be happening, then at the hundred and first blow, the stone splits into two. Don\u2019t stress yourself about the result you think you aren\u2019t seeing.

Fans of GOT are all different but they do come together in some ways bc of their shared experiences with GOT. \n\nMost fans are usually okay with sharing the love for GOT and get angry when some know-it-all company tries to do a top 10 GOT moments and list sex scenes for 3/4 of the video. The extremists are often ignored (but they do talk loud) and the try-hards only get eyerolled. Jerks are ppl who say, \"All GOT fans are perverts and are there for the sex!\" (Which is an oversimplification that erases the show's buildup) or actively avoid GOT fans bc, they're GOT fans.

To have the thing of your culture boiled down to nothing but \"pretty hair!\", \"Funny clothes\", \"Funny accent!\" Is downright insulting. Yes the hair is pretty, yes the clothes look different and yes, we may have an accent but there's history and reasoning behind all that; there's actual blood, sweat and tears of our ancestors behind all that. So the \"ching chongs\" and the \"I rik-ee suh dog!\" has nothing on my mountain culture who was able to understand eachother through instruments and whistles alone.\n\nWhile \"not seeing race\" is a good place to start, I feel like it only let's you see half a person. Race and culture molds us, we may not act the same but there are some things people of the same race/culture will understand. To see race and treat them in regards to their race isn't racist, to see race and think of them as simply lesser, is. Would it be okay if I can express my view on your question?

I don't know if you intended it, but the way you worded some of this makes it seem like you think he did this to himself, which isn't really the case if he is schizophrenic, and it's possible you may be putting off that vibe without realizing it when you see him which is why he spirals. \n\nDo NOT try to 'fix' him. You don't know near enough about any of this and he needs a professional whether he actually has schizophrenia or a serious drug problem. There's no shame if you can't handle being around someone who isn't ready to seek help, but if it can be avoided don't just disappear on him. Hell maybe even try writing him a letter letting him know that while he's your friend and you care about him you can't jeopardize your own mental health until he gets help.", "This may sound like a dumb idea but go get yourself a crush/girlfriend.

If you make him \"just another person\" in social media it'll help you a lot. It helped me atleast.\n* Think of the reasons why you broke up and **take your time**. Be analytical, try to distance yourself from the relationship and look from the outside perspective.\n* Relationships, for me at least, aren't only what's fun and feels good. They are two (or more) people sharing a life and supporting each other grow. I believe that love is this as well. \n* Talk to someone that you trust. Even talk to him if you feel that you can be rational about the conversation. just sit down and have a real conversation even multiple in a place where you feel comfortable andnot  in rush.\n* It's a bad place to think whether you're worth itr or he is worth it. Relationships aren't built on value just on how things work together.\n* Work on the things that might be affecting on your self esteem. And again **take your time**.

If we lived anywhere close by, I'd ask you to come spend NYE with me and my friends. We just finished poker night 2020 about 20 mins ago... I guess, you could talk on dm if you feel lonely?\n\nBasically, first you should try and make this into a learning experience for you, so, Lesson 1 is have friends outside of your romantic relationship. What I'm trying to say is have a circle of your friends who don't really have anything to do with your boyfriend. They can be close friends or just friends you occasionally hang out with. You'd be surprised how fulfilling such relationships can be. There really is such a thing as too much of a good thing, so, you need to have a friend circle that is outside the circle of your very close friends and so.\n\nLesson 2, it's NYE, nobody's judging you, do what you feel/think will make you happy right now. If it's the 3 hour drive then go for it. If it's staying in and getting drunk by yourself, do it. If you spend time with yourself, make sure to really treat yourself really well. What often happens in a relationship is that the two people (or three etc., depends on the relationship) really don't have as much time to themselves as they used to, so, definitely relish the alone time  you will now have, because it's really important for your mental health to be able to spend quality time with yourself. This is what will always keep you in touch with your core self. If anything, it's even more important than time you spend with your so. Also, remember that there is nothing wrong with falling down **as long as you remember to get back up again**. \n\nLesson 3, always keep a mentality of 'something will come along'. Do what you have to do, do what you can do. In fact, always work hard and do what you think is right for you or will make you happy, even if it means taking a few risks and being a little disappointed from time to time, however, when you've done everything you can and dealt with the variables that are under your control (those variables are a precious few btw) **let go**. Let go and force yourself to smile a little. You've done all you can. No one can blame you even though everyone will and will look for ways to. But if you've done everything in your power, feel ecstatically happy and confident and safe, because **you did your job**. It's other people's job to blame, and bitch and moan (and sometimes it will be your job too) and leave 'em to it. Let yourself go and let go of the stress and learn to say fuck it (but only after you've done what you can). The exact mentality you want is 'I've done everything I can, something will come along. If it doesn't, c'est la vie!'\n\nFeel free to talk to me via dm. \n\nAs for what do single people do: like I said before, I did poker night with a couple of friends from around the neighbourhood. In the afternoon-evening I went to a bar with a few close friends because one of them had a gig singing there. We took photos and then I came home and had dinner with the friends from around the block and we played poker. Low key stuff, but fun and fulfilling. My bestfriend went home to spend NYE with her parents. Her dad and I talked a bit and wished each other a good year. I called her at 12 to wish her. I was supposed to go with her to her parents' but plans changed due to a family situation that was unforeseeable. I basically thought I'd have a pretty lonely NYE and I almost cried about it once or twice (before today) but then I just said to myself: 'something will come along' and let it go, and today turned out to be pretty great. Was it the best NYE ever?? Probably not, that will probably happen after I meet someone and we spend NYE together for the first time and who knows when that will be.... I did win poker night for the first time ever on the first day of the new roaring 20s though, so, that's something. Basically, what I'm saying is, with life, be very passionate and stubborn when pursuing your passions but otherwise, especially with the emotional stuff... you just gotta learn to be a bit mellow and laid back. At least, that's what works for me.

Lot of engineers I know skip this step and feel lost when they read a paper.\n\nIf you already have these prerequisite then problem might be due to lack of motivation : a question that is genuinely interesting, sufficiently challenging and solving it is enjoyable.

Pick a sub field which is rich and orthogonal to your current job. And try to select a problem from it. \n\nAnd having a support network is essential.

Good luck and happy role playing!", "I thought OP was talking about a dog or cat at first and had a nice wee giggle.", "i quit after smoking so long and after i quit i caved too before quitting again a bit later. the only thing that made me quit successfully was imaging if i died over something stupid like smoking or thinking about how disgusting for me to have gum cancer mouth cancer or fucked up teeth in general :/ having these negative feelings would ward me off. also i picked up online shopping and got totally hooked it kind of replaces smoking but once u get over the cravings after a month or two it\u2019s not bad!", "Honestly I went through something like this recently however I wasnt married. She ended up cheating on me and then realize i was the one she wanted to be with. It was never the same after that. I ended up breaking things off fully sometime later because I was scared. It really sounds like you are unhappy and even though you feel your best friends you need to look out for yourself and your personal joy of life. If I were you I'd give it one last hurrah. Give it everything you have. Talk to him about what your feeling. Even take your post and break it down. You say you want to be care free, well explain that to him, again and again. Explain that it is important for you and he needs to be open to exploring that side of things if you are going to make it work. He will have some things he will need too and that's something you'll have to be open to as well. Relationships are a 2 way street. The grass is greener on the other side. And as lame as it is to say, if it's meant to be it will, but dont force something that's ran its course. Goodluck with everything.", "If you do tell, there is a possibility that he will forgive her, and you will become an outcast.  I would talk to your husband about it, and ask him point blank - if it were him in his friends position, what would he want his friend to do?  Do any of your other friends know?  How did you find out?", "Start working out!! Changed my life", "Omg... seems like your a sweet guy with low self esteem.

I don't mean to sound rude but I think that is a very loose use of the word \"stalking\"", "Out of curiosity, where do you live OP?", "You're 14. Chill. Odds are you won't be together in 5 years anyway.", "I would work on your self esteem before dating, learning to love yourself can be an uphill battle but relationships can be very difficult with low self esteem. It breaks my heart to hear you talk about yourself like this and if someone is an asshole about your body then they\u2019re not worth a second thought. You\u2019re worthy of love and people who are worth that second thought won\u2019t be focusing on the flaws you see. It sounds silly but do some research on how to find self love and how to boost your confidence, speaking from personal experience it helped me a lot to start my journey of raising my self esteem.", "I assume you're tracking your nicotine intake and lowering it each month or so? Juul is still bad for you, you haven't successfully quit if you just switched to juuling. Also what helped me quit juul was going from mint to tobacco, i'd chain smoke mint pods all day, tobacco doesn't have the most pleasant taste, you will get used to it, but it's disgusting to chain smoke, so you will ultimately be smoking less nicotine in the day.", "Give em the old \u201cspirituality is personal\u201d spiel.", "Actually I think you're spot on MushroomBong. \n\nOP, people aren't annoying. This girl isn't annoying. Your feeling towards her doesn't define her (though it certainly defines you!). YOU are triggered by her. You should be asking yourself why that is. And also why you think it's your right to weigh in.\n\nTalking about a wakeup call.. here's one. You have ZERO CONTROL over how another person behaves. What they say, the things they do.. not up to you. What you do have control over is how you choose to respond. So be annoyed if you like. Really the only person who will be affected by your annoyance is you. Cranky by name, and by nature perhaps?\n\nI hope you can reflect a little, and focus less on the things you think others should change.. and a little more on your own life. \nPeace.", "Super unpopular feedback, but I think it\u2019s warranted here:\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be isolated from your mother, but you can expect that she may have different views.\n\nAcceptance doesn\u2019t mean you have to like it or agree with it, it just means you accept it. It\u2019s just like when you accept 2+2=4, you don\u2019t question if it\u2019s old school or not, you just accept it and move on. \n\nIf you want to change your mothers opinion, that takes savvy persuasion, not \u201cyou\u2019re old school mom and you need to get over it\u201d.

Not really your business on the \u201cwhy\u201d.\n\nRespect her boundary, man. Your moms view is your moms view and she\u2019s entitled to it.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t mean you need to surround yourself with her behavior.\n\nDo you and happy holidays my friend!", "Yes", "Well shit,Im in Europe Where are you from", "Oh yes. Ask her how she feels. Explore her concerns. But don't pressure. Have it as more of a discussion about what she needs then what you need. I think you need to talk more thoroughly with your girlfriend. It may well be you can come to an understanding you're truly happy with. But dont take her up on the offer until you think shes actually okay. And you need to accept that she might never be.", "I hope this doesn\u2019t come off as dismissive of your disability, but I feel like if you wanted to find a job you could. Finding a job isn\u2019t about landing a work environment which is perfectly suited to you, it\u2019s about finding a reliable source of income. Work sucks, but it\u2019s a natural part of life, and there are plenty of low-skill positions which do not require stellar eyesight (such as call-centers).\n\nThat said, your dad\u2019s idea that a person is defined by their work is ridiculous, but it\u2019s so engrained in his generation\u2019s mindset that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth trying to argue. It seems to me that your only options at this juncture are to either get a job, or accept that he\u2019ll judge you until you do. Alternatively you could make the argument that your studying is preparing you for a future high-quality job, and thus satisfying his need to see you employed.", "Lose them both. PLEASE. Your girlfriend deserves a guy who LOVES HER Nah. You break up with your girlfriend since you don\u2019t like her anymore. But that girl you have a crush on is in a relationship. Make sure the next time you\u2019re in a relationship that you don\u2019t let your mind wander, and if it does then don\u2019t be in a relationship. You\u2019re an asshole", "Hello, interior designer here. That space is plenty large for you to enjoy your walk in closet without putting a desk in there.

The clackiness of a keyboard won\u2019t make enough noise to be heard through the walls. \n\nI would put your desk on the wall opposite of your bed. Having a nice closet like this is great for storage and the space shouldn\u2019t be wasted if you can avoid it. Storage space is often more valuable than room space, so I truly wouldn\u2019t put your desk in there if you can avoid it.

I don't know how to remove them from you're dreams but I hope you find a way.", "You bet. If you have any follow up questions hit me up. I'd say go meet other people. When I was a teen, I really liked a few girls who didn't like me back. My dad told me to keep trying and one day I met a girl and asked her on a date. She said yes, and 16 years later we've been married 10 years and have 2 kids. We have an amazing life together and I wouldn't have met her if I hadn't got back out there. Be encouraged to keep looking for who you're meant to be with.", "I mean in my experience it\u2019s insanely hard to request a day off if it\u2019s less than two weeks until the day without finding somebody to pick up the shift.

You're teaching yourself how to DRAW, which is a big task. \n\n\"But, Spicy, you said the tools don't matter- so why can't I start on the computer?\"\n\nOP, you can! It's your journey. This is just my advice, from my own experience. Start however feels best. You start by drawing with pencil and paper. Draw simple objects, real things- like a mug, a book. This is to train your eye-hand coordination, and to learn about shapes, volumes, shadows and highlights. \n\nDraw people. Draw yourself in a mirror. Ask friends to sit from you. Draw from photos- but don't trace. Look, draw. Train your eye.\n\nDrawing isn't about the tools, which is why I advise starting with the simplest ones. \n\nDraw every day. Watch YouTube tutorials.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll work for you, but I prepared a really long list of things that I wanted to address, and started out small.

It\u2019s no use arguing with them and getting angry as they\u2019ll only feel that that\u2019s another reason they can\u2019t trust you. I\u2019ve realised through those many discussions with my parents that it all comes down to them loving us and being afraid to lose us.

People who have a genuine interest in someone have a sense of closeness to them due to how well they know each other.\n\nHonestly, you do not owe this girl any emotional connection because you have not formed one to begin with. I agree with the other person who replied. You should keep your distance, and try to keep in mind that she is not your responsibility. Her problems are not yours to bear when she barely knows you and it is not your fault if she chooses to deal with the rejection in an unhealthy way. Distance yourself from her friends as well, and if your friends are blaming you, try explaining to them that you have no emotional obligation to someone just because they like you when you do not like them back. If they don't understand, then ask them to not get involved in it, and if they keep being dicks to you, try to hang out with other people who are not going to.\n\nOverall, just dont let yourself get caught in taking care of someone who you dont owe anything to, especially when you actually have no interest in them. Adding to it or passively letting it continue will ultimately hurt the both of you in the end even more and lead to a worse outcome. It will not be easy but you need to hold your ground and keep your own head above water. You deserve to find someone who likes you for you and give yourself time to discover who you are romantically.

And Make sure this memory ties into what the good quality was", "I guess we'll have to agree to disagree then. I'm fully aware that criminalizing things doesn't always lead to their disappearance, although it may discourage people. I wouldn't really advocate for making all these kinds of speech illegal anyway, the people that make them just have to be responded to in a responsible way or just not platformed in the first place.\n\nDictating other people's actions is what laws are for, and I don't think you would seriously argue that no laws work just because some people will get around them sometimes. Of course focusing on being a better person is a good thing, but we wouldn't have made it where we are as a society if we acted out this \"every man for himself\" mentality.\n\nAnd of course morality is subjective, but that doesn't mean that we can't agree on some level that things are right or wrong. As much as its not up to us to decide, I would hope you would say that rapists are wrong, even if that's subjective to some degree.\n\nI don't think current day Nazis should be given a pass for everything they say just because \"it's just speech\". Words have power, and if you didn't believe that, you wouldn't be trying to convince anyone of anything. So first off, yeah probably. That's why you can't falsely say \"Fire!\" in a public theatre, because preventing people from saying obviously harmful things is something we as a society have agreed has to be done sometimes. Beliefs tend to die out if no one is publicly talking about them, and terrible beliefs should die that way.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't entirely disagree with you. Sometimes bad ideas need to be publicly diaplayed in order for people to say, \"Wow, what a bad idea that was\". It opens them up to criticism and feedback from those around them. But if bad ideas go uncontested and everyone just laughs or agrees with them, then what? If no one can *responsibly* platform and contest those bad ideas, showing them to the public probably hurts society more than it helps.\n\nIt's also really irresponsible to compare censoring some forms of speech to \"banning gays\". You get to choose your speech and it has a chance to hurt others, while being gay is not a choice and can't realistically hurt anybody.\n\nFinally, the legality of something doesn't really have any bearing on its morality. Just because a government could make certain speech illegal doesn't make that speech wrong. I'm not trying to base this on \"how I feel\", I'm basing it on the practical ways that humans and free speech work. I am all for free speech, until it starts threatening peoples' other freedoms. Okay, but abhorrent words often turn into abhorrent actions... shouldn't we be trying to help people to recognize that they might be heading down a path that might harm others?\n\nFor example, even if you don't actually do anything to personally harm any gay people, can you see how telling other people, \"Gays aren't human\" could lead to those people taking matters into their own hands and feeling justified?\n\nI can't imagine you would be so quick to defend the guy who wrote Hitler's speeches just because he didn't physically kill anybody. I don't know if you're genuinely willing to hear other opinions, but please read my other comment if you are. At the end of the day, words are how we justify our actions, and that is why it's important to manage them carefully. You're not being overly sensitive. As much as people like to pretend that words are just words, they always mean something. It sounds like your coworkers don't have much respect for women, and while that may not directly impact you, if you care about your female coworkers (and it seems like you do), you should probably speak up.\n\nJokes can sometimes be harmless in and of themselves, but when they foster an attitude of degradation and objectification, they poison people's minds in a way that makes them unfortunately want to drink more poison. If their jokes revolve around seeing women only as sexual objects, it's not a huge stretch for them to get to joking about women being subjugated or controlled. From there, they might slowly start to seriously think of women as property, and from there, it's not a long trip to the logic of, \"I can break my own property if I so choose, that's my right\". The same kind of thing happens when it comes to homophobic or even racist jokes. As a very important figure in my life once told me, \"If you understand that in every joke, there's at least a little bit of truth, you'll have a lot more insight into the people telling the jokes and the people laughing at them.\"\n\nThere's no easy way to engage with that kind of behavior, but I tend to try to use humor in a way that highlights the absurdity of those negative attitudes toward women and gay people. Even then, those attitudes are often so ingrained that they may not be willing to change them, but if you can make that effort, I'm sure your female coworkers would appreciate it. Wow.

And he will tell my daughters new step mother as well. \n\nIf he would freak out about something like that, then that's something you guys as a couple absolutely have to work on.  You should never feel like you can't discuss something this important with your husband and if this is the case, you should seek counseling.  Remind your husband about last time when you told your ex's wife it turned out badly so he needs to promise not to do anything rash without consulting you first.\n\nOtherwise you have two concerns.  The main concern is your daughter.  You want to make sure your daughter has as good of an environment as she can have when she's with your ex.  The second concern is the ex's wife.  It's not as major of a concern but it's a concern because she's a good person and you like her.  You don't want to be a marriage breaker but you don't want her to suffer the pain of being cheated on.  \n\nPersonally this is what I would say your game plan should be (and tell your husband the game plan of course and let him read the messages you send/receive): \n\n1. Suggest to your ex to go into marriage counseling.  Let him know very politely and inoffensively that you're happily married and have no interest in anything with him other than being a co-parent.  Tell him it's in his interest to fix his marriage and that he should seek couples therapy/marriage counseling because it's not fair for his wife and it's not fair to him if he's unhappy too.  \n2. Tell him if he doesn't seek counseling and continues this behavior then you're going to eventually tell his wife these things: He told you that he was unhappy for some reason in the marriage that he wouldn't tell you specifically.  That you suggested therapy/counseling but he said he didn't want to try it.  You're going to suggest to her that she try counseling/couples therapy because it's better to nip problems in the bud than let them grow.\n3. If he STILL continues, then tell his wife what you said you'd tell her.  Let him know what you told her afterwards.  Ideally they go to therapy and work out their problems and that problem is solved (and you might be the hero even!).  At worst, you were vague enough that if they choose to sweep the problems under the rug they can and hopefully your ex will stop bothering you knowing that you're serious when you say you're going to tell the wife.\n\nBut note that how well this will turn out depends on the personalities of everyone involved so take that into account.", "You are guilty of threatening and terrorizing someone.

I would suggest you too to reflect some time over this and get to the root of the issue. I bet you are sad when you hurt people and they go away. You are capable of finding this out and i wish you the best of luck!!!", "I actually do completely relate. Went through the exact same stages when I was younger. What happens is you make people feel awesome when they first meet you, and then through you being you, you make them feel awful about themself.\n\nThink of someone who is only nice. You think they'd make a lot of friends right? Wrong. If someone is overly nice all the time, they're disliked because others think the nice person is trying to take advantage of them or is making them look bad.\n\nI am going to go into two parts:  1st part is how I figured out that I really wasn't looking for friends. Maybe you're like that too. 2nd part is if you do want to make friends, how to do it. This is also copy/pasted from previous advice of mine, slightly edited. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that matters is what's important to you. I tangled with the concept of having friends, but it all boiled down to the fear that perhaps no one likes me. What I wanted was someone who liked what I liked, who I could easily do everything I liked with, and to just enjoy each other's company. Stuff like coffee, video games, restaurants. I was just lonely. I just needed a significant other and everything clicked once I did.\n\nWe all decide what's important to us, subconsciously or consciously. Having friends means the trade-off of perhaps not having the time doing what we truly enjoy. You've put studying above work. Look to your role models. Do they have a giant group of friends, or are they more a lone wolf? \n\nLastly, before I go into the second part, I did start making friends. However, upon doing so, I realized that it wasn't what I was looking for simply because it didn't match up with my goals and who I was. So I can assure you, what I am about to go into works. I'm not saying you aren't doing this already, however, but perhaps you might be missing one or two of these things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo make friends, the first step is to **be someone you want to be friends** with. Be interesting. Have a hobby and something you can talk about. If you're someone who is just interested in being friends and doing things with people, then you're easily forgotten. You need to bring something to the table. If someone says they did something you wanted to be a part of, say \"I love doing that. That's awesome.\" It'll make them think about doing it with you.\n\nThe second step, and by far the most important step that drives the rest of these steps, is to **constantly and always validate people**. Everyone is looking for approval. If you want to be considered important to them you need to validate them. I know you're looking to be validated too, but you need to give out validation in order to get it. You need to give validation, every time. If someone you want to be friends with talks to you, you need to pay utmost attention and give them validation. If you do have something more important, listen to them initially, make perhaps two or three comments, then say you need to get to something and will ask about it later. If someone talks to you and you don't validate them, they'll forget about you. Even if someone does something for you or gives you a gift, show that you enjoy it. They're looking for appreciation for giving you something by you being happy for it.\n\n**Avoid making stuff about yourself.** After listening to someone, never ever say \"Oh that reminds me of one time I...\" or \"Oh I had that happen to me once...\". When using these lines, it looks like you're trying to one-up them as though what they experienced didn't really matter or isn't that important compared to you. They were looking to be validated and doing this does the opposite. Try to avoid using the word \"I\" as much as possible unless someone specifically asked about you.\n\n**Engage, but be comfortable with silence.** If someone talks to you about something, listen. Ask questions to get deeper into the story. If you're just getting to know someone new, ask questions but don't make it an interrogation. Silence is your friend. If you ask a question and they give a short answer, don't worry about \"Oh no I need to think of another question.\" Let the silence sit and act like you're still listening to them. They'll realize \"Oh they want to listen\" and sometimes talk more. Even if they don't talk more, they'll feel comfortable about you giving them space. Again, if you feel you dug deep enough into their story and want to change the subject, don't worry about that. Just stop asking questions and sit in the silence with them. It shows that you can take a break to think about the recent conversation. They'll more than often engage you.\n\nLast thing: don't worry. Be relaxed. Avoid acting like you're seeking approval. If someone has a problem with something you're doing, they'll bring it up. Never ask \"Is it ok that we're doing this\" or \"Hey are you having fun doing this\". By being confident and enjoying what you're doing, that's what matters. They're happy because you're doing something you like, and feel validated because they're allowing you to have fun. If you ask them \"Are you having fun doing this?\" it makes it very apparent that you were more worried about them, and suddenly they don't feel validated for being there for you. **If you're having fun, they're having fun.** So when you make the plans of gaming, coffee, stuff that isn't just drugs and alcohol, don't worry about the people who come or don't. Be happy and validate the people who showed up for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust small additions that aren't absolutely necessary, but good to keep in mind:\n\n\\-Follow up with people. True friends keep in mind what their other friends are doing. They'll ask \"how was that final you told me about yesterday\".\n\n\\-True friends also wait for each other when walking together. It gives you a key onto how far along in a friendship you are, and/or if they want to be your friend.\n\n\\-Avoid complaining. It can definitely be fun to complain about something happening in our lives, but if that's all someone does it drives people away. Avoid complaining when doing something fun, it leaves a bad memory and it's correlated with you.\n\n\\-Don't cut people off because you think they don't like you. Keep an open door for a relationship, people won't hate you if you always treat them like a buddy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObligatory \"When you're older, you'll look back and wonder why you were ever worried\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust a final note however, and take it with a grain of salt because I don't know you and how you act: You mention 'cry-laughing' by the end of friends stories, being told 'you're really funny', and friends hanging out with people they told you they hate. \n\nCry-laughing can put people off, it might be a bit over the top and weird at times, which people wouldn't want to continue. If someone is really funny due to certain jokes, some of those jokes might not be appropriate depending on the crowd, and the joke teller might be left out. Lastly, if friends hang out with people they say they hate; they may have said they hate those people to simply agree with another person in the group.

There's a difference between protection from a dog who is attacking and willful ignorance on teaching your kid not to be a fucking monster to avoid this exact situation. If she wanted to protect her son, she would've taught him how to interact with the dogs safely. I'm a mother to a small child, and we just recently got a kitten from the shelter. He's only four.

I\u2019ve come to try and put as much of the fucked up stuff of my past, in the past as much as possible (doesn\u2019t always work, but I try). And as for the not being around other people bit, same! For me it helps to be connected somehow. That\u2019s the main reason I got Reddit. When it comes at school, it really sucks. I can\u2019t be sure how exactly it manifests for you (general sadness? A sudden \u201cvoice\u201d saying you\u2019re not good enough?) but for me it\u2019s generally panic attacks. (Certain classes, such as PE (which I\u2019m aware sounds pathetic to most people, but I can\u2019t do much in sports and my teachers don\u2019t understand that) can bring them on). Just try and breath through it (whatever it is) and try to remove yourself if there\u2019s a trigger. \n\nI think the generic definition of being suicidal is having thoughts or intents to kill yourself. But in my own previous and current experience (which is eerily similar to yours) it\u2019s more complicated than that. I (like you) have no real intent to commit suicide, both because of my parents and those around me, as well as my fleeting hope for the future. And although I have self harmed in the past, I\u2019m not going down that road again, and I\u2019d advise you not to either. It\u2019s exactly what people say, a horrible addiction that normally takes A LOT of therapy to break. (Only reason I didn\u2019t need therapy was because one of my friends where I used to live, shook me out of it early enough.) \n\nAbout the constant cloud with it getting worst occasionally, yup, I think that\u2019s what depression basically is. Though I\u2019d advise that you don\u2019t try and label it yourself because (in my own personal experience) it could make it worse. It could fill your thoughts with even more thoughts of not being good enough (hard to explain, could go into more detail if needed). \n\nAlso, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re thinking about telling someone, it really does help. I\u2019m working on building confidence to tell either one of my friends or the people in charge of student problems at my school. I\u2019ve realized (from another post I made) that they don\u2019t really have a right to share anything like that with my parents. And I\u2019m happy you\u2019re gonna check out \nr/mentalhealth. Some posts have legitimately helped me during ruff bouts of loneliness/anxiety. \n\nRants are fine. They allow people to express their feelings. Sorry this answer is less \u201cformulated\u201d than my first one. And sorry that it\u2019s so focused on MY experience at some points. I just hope that from me sharing some of my stuff will help you hopefully not feel alone in this (if you did before). Hey! Very similar problem here! Whoo!\n\n\nBut seriously, I can\u2019t talk to anyone because I have a reputation of dealing with things perfectly fine, but I don\u2019t. My situation is a bit different since it\u2019s more anxiety from school and a few memories from my early childhood that haunt me (in short: had an abusive asshole as a birth male parent, and memories of what he\u2019d to to my poor mother hurt me). I want to tell people but fear of it getting to my parents plagues me (like you, pretty normal parents, they just have high expectations). \n\nI have a question, does it come as attacks/waves (feeling fine one minute, then feeling like you\u2019re drowning another?) or is it like a constant cloud of sadness? If it\u2019s the former, like I\u2019m dealing with now, try and make use of the good/okay times. Do whatever you feel like doing to try and keep the good going as long as possible. If it\u2019s the latter, as I dealt with when I was like 11, try and break through the cloud. It\u2019s difficult, but just try and stay afloat at first, then try to get out. Takes a lot of time and effort/willpower, but it\u2019s doable. (Of course, the best solution would be seeking help). Also know that whatever you\u2019re feeling is valid (something is still struggle with). \n\nDeep question here: are you suicidal? If so, same question at before, waves or clouds? Either way, being suicidal is very serious (even if you don\u2019t really have any intent) so please try to muster up the willpower to tell someone if you are. \n\nLastly, please try and tell a friend, if they are a good friend worth keeping, this won\u2019t ruin your friendship with them and will even possibly strengthen it. If you can\u2019t possibly tell a friend, tell a teacher that is caring at school, or a counsellor if there\u2019s any at your school.

Medication is great, but therapy is where the work happens.  \n\nYour sleep patterns sound difficult. Sometimes you sleep 12+ hours, sometimes you can't sleep at all. That's got to frustrating.  \n\nThe two things I recommend are going to make you roll your eyes, but please hear me out: exercise and nutrition. Those two words often invoke images of fitness magazines and health food stores, but that is not what I am talking about. I'm not telling you to cut out your favorite foods and run a marathon (I ate fried chicken and Funyuns for dinner last night). I am not a nutritionist or a personal trainer. I wouldn't even say I am in great shape, but I am healthy. Instead, I offer tips to help you bring better exercise and nutrition into your life a little at a time. These things help me, especially when I am battling depression.  \n\n####Exercise  \nExercise works your muscles, and sleep repairs muscles. Exercise helps you sleep, sleep helps you exercise. But the KIND of sleep is different. When you wake up, you actually feel rested and refreshed because your body has been repairing itself all night. You won't see immediate results, but you will notice slow changes after a couple of weeks.  \n\nDon't overthink it; just move. Stretch. Walk. Stretch some more. Try to walk fast enough until you are breathing faster and deeper. If your legs get sore, slow down. Take it easy at first. As your legs get stronger, you will be able to walk faster.   \n\nPlay disc golf -- it's just walking and throwing a frisbee. How hard could it be? Can't throw a frisbee? Me neither. Just throw it. Does it take you several tries to hit the target? Who cares?  \n\nMy brother told me that Pokemon Go helped him get through depression because it gave him a reason to go outside. I started playing it early this year when my depression was at its worst, and it helped. I didn't know anything about Pokemon when I started. I still don't. Who cares?  \n\nDon't want to go outside? Play some music and dance. Go for it. No one is watching.  \n\n####Nutrition  \nThe Latin word *nutrire* means \"to feed or cherish.\"  English words that stem from this word are *nutrition, nurture, nutrient, nourish,* and *nurse.* Before these words appeared in English, they came from old French words meaning: to raise or bring up (a child), to foster, to nurse, to promote strength or growth, to develop, to support, to maintain.  \n\nThink of nutrition using these definitions. You did not get that kind of nurturing from your father, but you deserved it. You still deserve it. You are worthy of good food. Recognize the dignity of your humanity by preparing and eating good food.  \n\nI won't say much about this here unless you want to hear more, but the Bible is loaded with references of food and nourishment. People ate when they were weary and mournful, and they ate to celebrate. Jesus provided food, cooked for his friends, and ate with his friends. For centuries, the Christian faith has included a practice of eating bread and drinking wine or juice as a symbol of unity and as a reminder of Jesus's love.  \n\nConsider nutrition as part of your therapy and self care. So what do you eat? Again, don't overthink it. Keep it simple. Eat foods that grow. Vegetables grow. Fruits grow. Chickens grow. Fish grow. Milk comes from cows, goats, and sheep that grow.  \n\nFunyuns do not grow, so I eat them in moderation. I enjoy eating Funyuns, so they nourish my mind more than my body, and that counts too!  \n\nEat a variety of foods. Eat some fruits and vegetables everyday. You don't have to count them. Just eat them. Eat a salad, even a Caesar salad, which is just lettuce, cheese, and a heavy dressing. It's got vegetables, so who cares?  \n\nEat plenty of fiber. Fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Your body turns starch into sugar, and uses it as quick energy. When your body uses it all up, you quickly crash and get very tired. But if the starch has fiber in it, your body will digest it slowly, so you will have a slow build up of energy that lasts longer.  \n\nFiber also helps with your body's water balance by helping to eliminate waste (pooping). If you are dehydrated (you probably are), your body will pull water from the waste, making it difficult to go. When you are eating enough fiber, your body gets rid of it and redirects water to other areas that need it, like your muscles, heart, and brain. When your muscles, heart, and brain have plenty of water, you feel more energized.  \n\nThe important thing to remember is that you are not a failure. Failure is an event. Not passing a test is a failure. An overcooked dinner is a failure. A wrong turn is a failure. Missing an alarm clock. Missing a bus. A minor car accident. A big car accident. These are all failures. The person doing them? Not a failure.  \n\nEvery day I fail at something. It's an opportunity to learn something new about myself. If I focus on the failure, I'll never improve. If I focus on the learning, that's a success.", "Use condoms", "ThermaCare heating pads and pamprin! (: I work at Walgreens and people say that's what helps best! Plus what the others have said haha.

But of course you\u2019re not gonna listen Wait, what? I thought you were a biological male from how you worded the post. You said you considered yourself a guy for quite a while but now are questioning your gender? Even how you talk about this is confusing.\n\nI don\u2019t think your degenerate \u201cgroups\u201d help to increase much tolerance among people with common sense, since those mostly just force these delusional identities down everyone\u2019s throat. It\u2019s attitudes like that that motivate people to commit acts of violence against queers. Maybe if you stop being so disgusting, people will be less disgusted by you.\n\nAnd yes, they are perverted in many ways. I don\u2019t have to get into that and calling out atrocious perversion and degeneracy for what it is is most certainly not a dick move. So evaluate your world view, miss. Just because some people failed at changing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s already 100% possible because people are successful at it. Radical mentalities like yours where \u201ceveryone lgbt has to embrace their identity and if you disagree you\u2019re homophobic/transphobic\u201d are what make these individuals commit suicide because nobody around them will take their potential and willingness to change seriously. Nothing I said in this thread is wrong or harmful.\n\nAs for going on the sub you mentioned, maybe I will, but I know it would just be more of the same exhausting arguing with radical, stubborn perverts. Plus, that sub is fucking disgusting. And before you start accusing me of starting an argument with you, let me remind you that I simply gave advice and guidance you\u2019re the one who jumped in here saying you can\u2019t believe people like me exist and arguing, so get off your high horse mister This is why I say you are a lost cause. You and the people who downvoted refuse to listen and you\u2019re saying I\u2019m the one who\u2019s brainwashed? I just came to the conclusion this stuff was horrible on my own thanks to common sense without idiots all over the place promoting it, as well as mainstream media. So I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not brainwashed lmao. I do not see any hypocrisy in not being against people with problems but being against the embracement of those problems.\n\nAnd by shitting out that cliche, blatantly incorrect message that people are born the way they are and cannot change further shows you are brainwashed. Sexuality doesn\u2019t develop until later on in life, and all the people who change to being straight prove that it can indeed change. You may be right that being forced to change by others is harmful, but lgbt people willingly changing themselves has shown time and time again that it is not harmful. Holy shit, I guess you may be a lost cause then. Go and tell your parents you are fully intent on embracing your disorder and see how that goes, any sensible person would not approve of that. I gave you some advice that keeps your behaviour reasonable and may actually go over well with your parents but overreactions like what you just replied to me with are what keep society retarded and what would rightfully encourage your parents to go against you.\n\nWhen oversensitive leftists downvote my opinions, it\u2019s because they are crazy and brainwashed, not my problem, so quite the other way around as opposed to what you said. There is a **major** difference between being against the embracement of homosexuality and being against homosexuals as a whole. Anyone who wants to embrace that repulsive degeneracy has a fucking problem, but homosexuals who get help to become a reasonably decent human being are not worthy of being hated for the way they are. \n\nI never said you should be thrown into an asylum with a straightjacket but what your saying now has pretty much made me believe so. If being lgbt is the most ScArY and awful thing ever then you might want to, um, idk, STOP BEING IT? How clueless are you?? You\u2019re literally complaining about what I said is a problem. \n\nYour stubbornness to cling to degeneracy is astounding. When you don\u2019t even consider changing (which many have done and still are doing) as an option, you\u2019re just fucking up your life and making the world a worse place. Maybe instead of taking what I said as a reason to \u201cStAy In ThE cLoSeT\u201d, you could take it as a reason to change yourself for the better and cure your disgusting disorder instead of embracing it and being disgusting. In a sense, they are faking it. If you look at the logic behind this garbage and break it down, it all comes down to delusions and mental abnormality. Gender is biologically observable but these disgusting people want to make gender whatever anyone feels like it is in their head, which leads to countless disgusting delusions being embraced. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that gender dysphoria is fake by any means, as it is a very real and problematic mental illness. Whatever you do, do not ever embrace gender dysphoria or homosexuality, only brainwashed lunatics do that or support it, and, while I am wholeheartedly against homophobia and transphobia, it sounds like your parents/town more or less have the right idea.\n\nMy advice would be to talk to your parents and explain that you just think there\u2019s something wrong with you and get them on the same page by assuring them you\u2019re aware of how delusional practicing lgbt members are and that you will not embrace mental illness like they do. Then hopefully you can all come to an agreement and everyone can be happy.\n\nSeriously, do not embrace those disgusting mental disorders. The lgbt community is brainwashing people.

My advice is its a hobby but it's generally not worth the effort and cost for most people but that being said it depends what you want from it.\n\nMost content creators go for daily or two day video schedule and that's a lot to commit to. There's also a lot been leaked about how YouTube works lately so if you don't stick to schedule or your videos aren't sticking direct to YouTube's monitisation process, you just won't get views because your videos will never show up on peoples feed.\n\nOn top of that, YouTube also announced that it can now fully remove channels and videos if they don't fit the platform. I have had multiple videos claimed for copyright infringement for just playing a game with no music on the background by bots and all you can do is appeal it and hope you don't get denied or you lose all income for that video. Its bullshit honestly.\n\nThe side about YouTube deleting content is something you want to be particularly weary of. Many have lost videos for no real reason (myself included) and getting to speak to an actual person is impossible if you aren't someone like pewdiepie or jacksepticeye. Even Markiplier struggled getting his fans accounts back recently after YouTube auto banned hundreds of accounts because they spammed an emote in his chat (part of a video) and then refused to reinstate them which also means their videos were lost. Even now most of the accounts have been reinstated after backlash, they still have missing videos.\n\nMy advice is if you want to document your life then consider your own personal Dropbox, onedrive or even a big ass hard drive that you can save to instead.

Streaming media is not considered a \"special\" kind of media, because the definition is technical. When you begin a facetime call, both users are actively downloading and playing video that the other person is recording. The fact that it isn't implicitly stored is irrelevant. Think about the giant loopholes that would be created if they put streamed video in a separate category. Absolutely irrelevant dude! He put a camera in front of himself! How can you possibly argue that he did not know he was creating a video? Listen dude, what he did was illegal *before it ever even reached the woman who recorded it.* He pointed a camera at himself, switched on an app that streams video, opened a FaceTime video stream with a recipient and began streaming video to her. *That is all illegal before she ever started recording.* That's not really an analogy. She didn't record *him*, she recorded a piece of media he was creating and sending to her. What he did is a whole separate crime. Who she thought he was isn't really important. She's probably in India running a thousand of these scams a day. She has nothing to worry about. According to OP the kid confessed to making child porn, to the cops. They're not gonna chase after some Indian scammer but they might come for the boy. If she's in some other country then it is irrelevant because what can American paw enforcement do? She's outta their jurisdiction, but ya boy aint. It sounds to me like he just admitted to a really serious crime, directly to the cops, with no hope of the law helping him out. Y'all may have *really* fucked up here... That he was not the person recording is not relevant. In the eyes of the law that still makes him a creator and distributor. She may have been recording, but she was recording his performance that he was knowingly creating. From the legal standpoint, she was a customer soliciting child pornography and he was a creator/distributor fulfilling her demand. How is that even remotely relevant? Yeah its horrendous but it is more common than you think. Prosecutors know that nobody but the kids' parents give a shit about the injustice, and getting sex crime prosecutions through makes their stats look good. I agree that modern sexuality and technology are inextricably linked now, and it doesn't make sense to criminalize kids who safely begin exploring sexuality through their devices. I get it, *she also committed crimes* but none of that absolves a 16 year old of responsibility for producing child porn. I don't think \"I didnt realize that pornography involvong a child is considered child porn,\" is a good defense. I agree that it is bullshit and unjust that it works this way... but it works this way. I'm sure thats what he's saying, but if they were sophisticated enough to surreptitiously steal someone's nudes, they wouldn't be scamming kids for chump change. YES! Creating a sexually explicit image or video of a child is creating child porn. If it is child porn and you send it any place, you're the distributor. It doesn't mean shit if you're the star, according to the law you're still a child pornographer. Do you really think they'd leave a giant gaping loophole in the law like that? Dude a 16 year old who distributes sexually explicit images of himself has committed a very serious crime and prosecutors ***do*** go after that shit. Don't give people terrible advice that could ruin their lives. If I had to choose between some randos seeing my hog, or a lifetime on the sex offender registry, y'all woulda already seen my dick by now. He's in trouble too. He created the child porn. Dude if you think prosecutors won't go after a 16 year old for creating and distributing child porn then\nyou're dead wrong. So is creating and distributing the images. The 16 year old could be in just as much trouble. Ummm why is nobody mentioning that ***the 16 year old committed a pretty big crime by creating and distributing child pornography!*** Sounds like he is just as likely to go to prison as her.

So one thing I am wondering is that you said after you got our you made some great friends.  Why do you not feel that these friends are not ones you can share a deeper connection that you desire?  Also why do you feel that those people who ask how you are are not interested in your feelings?  I'm just trying to understand to better give you advice.", " I  had the Santa talk with my 7 year old this year.  She wanted to know if  Santa was real or not.  Instead of telling her if Santa was real or not  I told her what she believed was true, and if she wanted to see if  Santa was real or not to get proof for her case.  I also talked to her  about not trying to change the belief of her friend because that's a  waste of time.  I also told her Santa is not the only way to get \"what  we want\" \"gifts\".\n\nI made a video  after having this conversation because I know other mom's are not going  to know what to say when their kid has this same question....

Most 13 year olds are not mentally mature enough to be in a relationship with someone with a serious illness. Your looks and physical ability might not even be a problem.

You have to understand that these people really believe you're going to hell for not believing in their faith and as a teacher her job is to teach you.

Another way to last longer is to simply learn some self control. Anyway, on to why they actually ARE NOT normal things. \n\nFirstly, sex toys are generally not the culprit, so sure. Sex toys aren\u2019t bad, but I wouldn\u2019t call them \u201cnormal\u201d. It\u2019s DEFINITELY not normal to fork over $280 for a toy when you don\u2019t have $500 in your account. That\u2019s just the truth. \n\nAnyway, let me talk about the real culprit. Pornography. If used in moderation, in the right state of mind, then no, porn won\u2019t be harmful to you. It\u2019s similar to that of junk food. Where sex and nonvisual masturbation are your healthy foods; porn, visual stimuli (excluding when sharing it with a partner), and to a lesser extent sex toys, are your sexual junk food. Sexual urges are natural. Seeking pleasure is natural. Wanking your dick with a pocket pussy while you watch some girl getting anal fucked and drinking an ounce of fake jizz is NOT natural. Ask any man who is successful with women. Pornography indeed does set a precedent of unrealistic sex, and objectifies the men and women on film, so people who are addicted give them money. \n\nAddicted? Yes. There is such a thing as porn addiction, and it\u2019s very common. It\u2019s called dopamine. Dopamine is supposed to encourage us to eat, have sex, accomplish goals. It\u2019s our motivator. This is the natural way, the healthy way. But these receptors can also be hacked. Through means of overindulgence in bad foods, nicotine, drugs, and PORN. No. It seems you struggle with self esteem issues (as do I, no worries). That\u2019s what ACTUALLY need addressed and solved. If you really need to blow off steam, GO TO THE GYM. Please! It is SO worth it, and it boosts your confidence. Don\u2019t waste your money on sex toys. Don\u2019t watch porn.

That (probably) means there are other things in your life that you're so passionate about or so focused on that you forgot about sex! \n\nI'll share a bit of one of my experiences too, though I'm not sure how helpful it will be.\n\nWhen I was 30, I dated a 26 year old virgin. Hed never even been kissed iirc. He told me before we ever did anything that he was a virgin. He seemed very embarrassed and ashamed of that. \n\nUnfortunately,  at the time, I was still trying to get over an ex that had lied, cheated, done all of the awful things, and that I had dated for 3.5 years. I really wasn't ready to jump into a relationship but was ok with having a bit of fun and introducing this nerdy, intelligent, fun dude to the wonders of sex. \n\nI should have known better, being more experienced, that this was a bad idea. I'm naturally submissive so taking the lead, even for someone I cared so much about, was difficult and in the end,  frustrating for me. The sex itself wasn't a problem.  One of my favorite things about it is exploring a body and finding out what works and what doesnt. I didnt have high expectations for..er...performance,  because hed told me he was a virgin, therefore there was zero disappointment on my end as far as sexy stuff went. He was a quick learner and eager to please, an excellent student especially considering I'm not a great teacher.\n\nIt ended up not working out, not because of the sex. It was everything else. Like I said, I made the mistake of getting involved when I wasn't emotionally ready to do so. Second, we were both submissive in nature and I should have recognized that we might run into trouble because of it. \n\nThird, and I think the tipping point, was his complete lack of self esteem. He constantly beat himself up over trivial things. Nothing I did or said could help. Worse,  he had difficulty communicating his negativity. It became a constant game of 20 questions when something was wrong. He never could say \"I'm having a bad day because....\" or \"what you said was hurtful\". I never knew whether it was something I'd done to upset him or if that's just how he was feeling that day and it wasn't my fault.  It sucked because if I'd hurt him, I wanted to know so I could fix it and do my best never to do that again, while if I didnt do anything wrong, I'd just step back and be there if he needed it or give him space until he felt better. His combination of insecurity and lack of communication resulted in my constant stress and basically nagging to find out what was wrong  ALL the time. He was such a nice guy. It sucked. \n\nEventually I could see that no matter what I did he was hurting,  but he was too afraid to speak up. Eventually I asked if things were working for him and got a timid \"not really\" so I broke it off to let him free. Later, he came back and wanted just a physical relationship.  I'm usually ok with that, especially when I'm not emotionally ready for a full blown relationship,  but this time I declined his advances as kindly as I could. I didnt want to do any more damage than I already had. I also left the option of \"friend\" up to his discretion.  8 know how painful it can be to be sidelined and try to be \"friends\" but even more so to the person you lost your virginity to. He stayed friends with me for awhile, and I treated him as gently as I could, but eventually he wrote me a long email essentially saying he still had feelings for me and that it was best if we weren't friends. I was sad of course, but I understood. I still hold a special place in my heart for him and wish him the best.\n\nOthers have given you advice that is good, but until you go through the experience yourself you wont really know how you're going to feel or respond. \n\nThere definitely are women who want a newbie, so to speak, because its easier to show them exactly what you want and how you want it. There are less bad habits to undo, and far less baggage from others or exs to work through, theres a very low risk of STDs or baby momma drama.  \n\nI personally wont ever date another virgin, though. It's not them, *I* cant handle it. I'm *not* a good teacher and I cant relax and enjoy myself when I'm coaching as well. I get enough of that when entering a new relationship even with an experienced person. Theres nothing wrong with being a virgin,  and I myself lost my virginity relatively late at almost 21. IMO, the sex itself is the least thing to worry about. If you have a kind, patient, and supportive partner not being experienced is not a big deal. What's important is communication, trust, confidence, and giving your best. \n\nThere will be a fine lady (or gentleman) out there for you who will make sure your needs are met as well as theirs.

It's a very hard process to get started, but once rolling it's pretty much unstoppable, and walls fall one after another.\n\nIt's not possible (I think) to just begin and love yourself, bc all of the past abuse and pain participated heavily in how the brain was formed, and if the brain is not wired on love, one will not be able to just produce love from nothing. The brain has to be rewired. It always begins with the person being exposed to bits of love that they are susceptible to, that they feel and believe to be true.\n\nIf you put a person who's only experience betrayal, fear and pain in the middle of a very loving family, they will not be able to perceive any of it. They will distrust everything that surrounds them, because they're wired so far from all of this, that all of it will seem surreal and unabsorbable. And even infuriating, since the person will not know how to handle all these strange things, never having been exposed to them in the past. \n\nA person can perceive, and feel safe with and embrace that which is not very far from where they are internally, but it's a little bit better. \n\nIn the case of loving oneself, it begins with relating. Seeing what you've been through being told/painted/expressed by someone else is a powerful experience. This is a kind of love, to see your self mirrored in some way by another self, but in a non judgemental way. For example, you made a \"mistake\" that you were shamed and punished for, being made by someone else in a movie, but seeing that character in the movie being lovingly advised or accepted after that mistake. Watching that it will be as if seeing your mistake being forgiven by at least someone. It takes a weight out of it, and it also gives you perspective, \"wait, so maybe this person who punished me was wrong?\". This way a person begins to faimtly taste how affection and understanding feels like. \n\nSo the most crucial thing to happen to a closed and internally isolated person is to relate, relate, relate, but in contexts which come with understanding and acceptance. At some point the relating will not be necessary anymore, because the person will feel at some deep level supported, and they will want to see what's farther, beyond that pain, what it's like to just let it dissolve and live. \n\nIf you don't know anything about your friend's past, simply look at what happens with them and around them now. Try to google it, maybe you'll find something impactful on you, that you can then discuss it with your friend. Maybe tell them that you read about ____, and you think ____, and you wonder if ___, and ask what they think about that.\n\nI hope all that I said doesn't sound like a rant, I did try to make sense. If you know a/some specific traumatic episode(s) from their past, look it up and dive into it. See what effects it has on people subjected to it and simply discuss with your friend about these effects. Not as in \"x happened to you\" and god forbid not as in \"you must do this or that\", but to simply have conversations about these things as an existing phenomenon in the world. \n\nPeople in depression are not really UNinterested in anything, they just have their mental focus on things that are not conscious, hidden behind walls and twists, and those things are the meat of their pain.

Ive felt the same way over the \u201cyou need to complement yourself 5 times as soon as you wake up every day and then you\u2019ll magically be happy and love yourself \ud83d\ude44\u201d  types it just isn\u2019t realistic. \n\nit could be that the ones you\u2019ve seen techniques just don\u2019t work for you, there are so many different things that I didn\u2019t know about until my current therapist, like spot therapy (a weird thing but it\u2019s different from just talking and helps to process trauma) therapy shouldn\u2019t make you feel worse overall, like if you have a therapist who lets you leave session more agitated and upset than when you arrived then that\u2019s not a good therapist there should always be a cool down at the end and a check in with where you\u2019re at to make sure that you\u2019re at least at you\u2019re level of ok before you go Have you tried talking to a therapist about how you feel? I really think you should, I\u2019ve had similar problems and am also trying to work through them (21f) so I know it\u2019s hard and uncomfortable and until the fear of staying in the same cycle outweighs your fear of change it\u2019s even more hard. If you\u2019re able to shop around for a therapist, because if you\u2019re uncomfortable with them you won\u2019t want to allow yourself to grow  and that\u2019s the whole point.", "Hey, I know this is from a bit ago.

At the end of the day she was very toxic but she was not a monster.  She had her own inner turmoil and it manifested itself very negatively.  Ultimately that led to her not fostering the bond that would normally exist between mother and child.

Meaning you can\u2019t know what they learned from it. And you can never know everything they know. Which means there are definitely things that they know that you don\u2019t know. Intellect can carry you far, but wisdom and empathy are far more redeeming qualities that are rewarded even more in the western world.

Some have called me a genius to my face. And my whole family are pretentious people with superior complexes. I used to deny that I was smart so I would push myself harder to be even smarter.

Having more of one quality doesn\u2019t make you better than anyone. I don\u2019t think any life should be valued over another period, with very few exceptions unrelated to this comment. I\u2019ve been looked down on and called dumb growing up, which made me develop a really low self esteem, which I don\u2019t have anymore.

(People in religious texts are likely mixes of characters from folklore from Mesopotamia). Rather than looking around when your mind is idle and getting off to the idea that you\u2019re better than everyone, focus on how you can use your skills and talents to have a happy life. Obviously there are smarter people than you, but that doesn\u2019t matter because they\u2019re not better than you in the same way that you\u2019re not better than the people you\u2019re smarter than. Maybe you don\u2019t get off to the idea you\u2019re smarter, maybe you look down on others and feel some slight contempt. In that case it\u2019s to your benefit to look at others and smile, and think what you can learn from them, not only will it replace a negative attitude but it will bring you positivity.\n\n\nThat\u2019s the shit I\u2019ve been doing for a while and it works out imo. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better than anyone. I used to try to tell myself I\u2019m not smarter than others when they told me otherwise but I didn\u2019t want to sound like I was fishing from compliments.

You're welcome!! I'm glad you'll try, it could really help you out! I currently do not study psychology but I am enrolled in a sociology class! (Essentially the study of the society itself) I'm supposed to be taking psychology next semester though and I'm excited!\n\nRecommending books can be difficult because people like many different genres and tropes and settings but I'll try to give you some good beginner books!\n\nPopular beginner classics could be The Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, and To Kill A Mockingbird! If you like contemporary (Books that take place in everyday life) Perks of Being a Wallflower is very good and also beautifully written. If you're looking for a series that will really help you get in the hang of reading, Harry Potter is always a good place to start off at no matter how old you are! (If you dislike the movies, the books are insanely better) \n\nGoodreads is also a great website if you're looking for something you're interested in! That's how I picked up a few of my first books when I got back into reading. It's okay to need professional help! A lot of people think needing help physically is normal whereas needing help mentally is shameful and weird, but honestly everyone's lives are busy and sometimes we just need that help to help us out and realize we're okay. Everyone tends to have more mental and emotional issues than physical, they just seem to be more common, you're only human so you shouldn't feel ashamed!\n\nAlso that's cool that you work out too, so you already have a start at hobbies! I know video games can be a dangerous hobby because (I don't want to sound like a boomer or something I just study psychology a lot) it easily isolates you and you can be exposed to a lot of violence. If you do it too often (like for hours straight) it can also be bad for your health. I feel you though video games can be very fun!! Just make sure that's not the only thing you're doing all day! Being locked up in your room staring at the screen the whole day can make you feel worse. :( Especially if you're not enjoying it.\n\nI'm not really good at explaining how to just. start reading because it is very difficult at first but my advice (If you want to start) would be to just read every day. Doesn't matter how long, whether it's 5 or 100 pages, doing that will make your reading consistent and eventually you'll read more!\n\n[https://www.mantelligence.com/list-of-hobbies/](https://www.mantelligence.com/list-of-hobbies/)   &lt;------- Here's a list of hobbies that might interest you! Some are oddly specific and weird but you might be able to find something! I'd recommend the \"list of hobbies that are cheap\" section! Do you think your parents would mind you going to therapy, or at least asking for the money for it? If your parents care about your mental health I'm sure they'll understand, a lot more people go to therapy than you think. (Atleast in America!)\n\nWell, I don't have a lot of friends either, but I think I'm just looking forward for college and the future. People are nicer there and it's a less busier schedule, you also have more freedom! \n\nOther than working for my goals and stuff, distracting myself is how I'm currently pushing through. If you don't have any hobbies it could really help! I personally like reading (it takes me to another world where I don't have to worry about my current issues) and exercising! (it keeps me in shape and also gives me lots of endorphins aka The Happy Chemical) \n\n If you can find hobbies that give you small benefits like that, it could help a lot. :) Hi! Teen here as well, I've dealt with chronic depression on top of seasonal depression for about 5 years now, so I get where you're coming from. First of all, it's always healthy to realize it's not 100% your fault, just in case you do think that. High school is literally just a building that you're crammed into for 7-8 hours every week day and you're forced to socialize with people. And a lot of those people are going to be jerks. No wonder it's so hard. I mean, most adults say they despised high school unless they were the football player, the cheerleader, or just loaded. It's easy to get depressed in such a strenuous environment.\n\nHave you tried therapy? It doesn't work for everyone, but it's a great way to let out your emotions and get all that heavy tension out of you. Therapists are there to listen and help and understand, it's better to try it than to not try at all!\n\nIf for some reason you can't visit a therapist, try a school guidance counselor. \n\nJust remember, you can't interact well with other people if you don't focus on yourself first and make sure everything's okay.", "Glitter bomb.

I am so very sorry you're going through this. My heart hurts for you.\n\nI lost my mother very suddenly, just over three years ago now. Sometimes it feels like yesterday, sometimes it feels like an eternity. I was 26, and still I felt I was robbed of many precious years with my mother. 19 is so young, I am so sorry.\n\n\nMy mother was my best friend. We were incredibly close, and I told her things that others would think is insane to share with a mother. We had our low points, however. When I was younger she was a raging alcoholic, and I worried for her for her safety as far back as I can remember. Even as a young girl I worried that one day I'd wake up to find that she'd been killed in a car accident on her way home from the bar or something. For years I contemplated what I would do if I ever lost her. Still, despite those rough years, we remained very close, and became closer still once she stopped drinking and I became an adult.\n\n\nAs a child I always thought that, due to our closeness, I would have an incredibly difficult time when I finally did lose her. However, oddly enough it turned out to be the exact opposite. When we lost her so suddenly, I found it much easier to bear *because* of my strong connection with her. I knew that there was nothing I had failed to tell her, nothing I had failed to share with her, because I had always told her everything. She knew how important she was to me, how much I loved her, because I told her so just about every day.\n\n\nMy advice to you is to just talk with your mother as much as you can. Tell her everything that is on your mind, even mundane and silly things. Tell her everything that you might regret not saying later, and resolve any issues you might have, no matter how small. Speak now, or forever hold your peace. In my experience, always communicating my love for my mother is what helped me through my grief the most. There really is no way to prepare for a loss like that, and everyone grieves differently, but knowing that I had nothing to say that my mother hadn't already heard from me a million times was an *immense* comfort to me.\n\n\nI wish I could tell you what to expect. I wish I could tell you an exact time as to when you'll begin functioning normally again, but I can't because it's different for everyone. Personally, as soon as I lost her I felt this strong yearning for normalcy. I went back to work three days later, because I needed to feel normal. Looking back on it now, I wish I'd taken a little more time for myself, because I'm realizing more and more that there's still a lot of grief that I've yet to unpack, even three years later.\n\n\nJust do what feels right for you, because, ultimately, nothing and no one can prepare you for something like this.", "So nice of you to wanna teach him wrong from right.

It is not bigotry. It is an informed understanding of the history of the Catholic Church It speaks volumes that rather than attempting to provide specifics in an attempt at refuting these historical realities, you instead repeatedly insist on deflecting with scurrilous and sophomoric personal attacks. All still part of the core governing policies of the Catholic Church throughout the centuries. \n\nYour failed retort only means that the Catholic hierarchy was not only evil and immoral, they were also religious hypocrites Those historical events and institutions were all the direct result of the core official policies of the Catholic Church.\n\n\nAs a supposed \"historian\", you should understand that fact Then how do you explain the Inquisition, the Crusades, heresy trials and the role of the Church in forced conversions over many many centuries? The extreme oppression and eradication of any form of competing theology and the aggressive protection of the power and the authority of the Church at all costs are both central concepts throughout the history of the Catholic Church If the Confederacy had won the war and had achieved a great deal of good for its white citizenry, would that mean that we should overlook the horrors of multi-generational chattel slavery? The Catholic Church has done some truly horrific things in the past, as well as in the not so distant past.\n\n\nWhy shouldn't the Catholic Church be judged in that regard? I never once talked about \"all Catholics\" being evil. Show me where I EVER made such a claim? Why do you feel the need to deliberately lie about my clearly stated positions? Are my observations of historical fact hitting a bit too close to home for you? \n\n\nI was talking very specifically about the evil committed by the Catholic Church as a centralized theological/political entity. \n\n\nIt is quite telling though that so far you have absolutely refused in any way to acknowledge that the Vatican Rat Lines ever existed or that the overtly religious Usta\u0161a engaged in utterly horrific acts of genocide in Croatia and that those crimes against humanity were specifically committed in the name of advancing Catholicism.\n\n\nAs a \"historian\", you are aware of those historical truths, aren't you? Are you claiming that they committed their crimes specifically in order to advance the cause of atheism? What specific evidence do you have for such a claim?\n\nOn the other hand, is there any way that you can deny the overt Catholicism of the Ustashe and the Croatian Nationalists? Hitler was raised as a Catholic, Stalin studied for the priesthood and Mao patterned his cult of personality on theistic models of cultural control The central Catholic hierarchy was directly aware and complicit in the existence of the pro-fascist Rat Lines and the horrific crimes of the Ustashe in Croatia. \n\nWhen the Catholic faithful absolutely refuse to acknowledge the evils committed by the Church, why should anyone ever grant those faithful any respect of any kind? As someone with a history degree from U of M...\n\nCan you explain the Catholic Rat Lines that helped to smuggle Nazi war criminals out of Europe and away from the hand of justice after the war?\n\nCan you explain the complicity of the Catholic Church in the utterly horrific genocidal crimes of the Usta\u0161a in Croatia? &gt; . I have a degree in it.\n\nYou should ask for a refund on your tuition. &gt; Western Civilization wouldn't have developed without the Catholic Church.\n\nUtter rubbish!\n\n\nAre you completely unaware that Western Civilization predates the Catholic Church by several millennia? \n\n\nAre you also unaware that many of the doctrines and policies of the early Catholic Church effectively censored and in many cases obliterated huge amounts of classical knowledge, thereby setting the advance of Europe back by many hundreds of years (If not even longer...)?\n\n\nAs regards your claims about universities, the Islamic world had established universities many centuries before the Europeans ever did.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_al-Qarawiyyin\n\n\nDo you know ANYTHING about factual history? Pell has been convicted and his appeal rejected. \n\n\nBut he is still being defended and supported by the Church hierarchy. \n\n\nJust as they have supported so many other abusers in the clergy. \n\n\nThe reality is that the Church has a long and tawdry history of this sort of unconscionable behavior. A history that you are very obviously in denial of. Not a bigot. Just a realist who happens to know people who have been victimized by the Catholic Church, its clergy and it's adherents.\n\nPell could have been defrocked and excommunicated quite some time ago. The problem for the Church is that doing so would effectively amount to a public admission of his guilt and would invariably weaken the Church's legal defense strategy against all of the well deserved lawsuits and inevitable financial penalties. And yet, Pell is STILL being protected and defended by the Church. Just as so many other pedophiles and sexual abusers have been sheltered and hidden by the Church in the past.\n\nIs it your claim that the \"good\" done by the Church effectively mitigates and erases all of the harm that has undeniably occurred? What do you think that all of the various victims would say in that regard? Given the long history of misdeeds and atrocities involving the Catholic Church, I rather doubt that these supposed \"reforms\" will amount to much of anything more than a public relations campaign primarily designed to protect the Church's reputation and finances.\n\nFor example... Has Cardinal Pell been defrocked and excommunicated yet? Has the Pope ever publicly denounced Pell for his predatory crimes? Does the general population of sexual abusers and pedophiles have behind them one of the richest and most powerful multinational corporations on the planet, a huge global geo-political enterprise with a well established history of protecting and hiding those abusers from law enforcement and courts of justice? I have no such problem and given the track record of the Catholic clergy, I wouldn't ever trust trust a Catholic priest to counsel me about anything concerning human sexuality Really? Has he ever published his research in accredited peer-reviewed scientific/medical journals?\n\n\nPlease provide links.

Nobody wants to always be told \"later\". \n\nIf you continue to get nonstop texts/messages, just say you're busy right now or ignore them.

I also have a brother who is around your age you dropped out of a school a few years ago and is in another right now which he isn\u2019t happy with. My number one advice to my brother and others in similar situations, and you, is that if it Is possible, try to finish the program. This will help you have something to put on your resume and it will be an accomplish that you will be proud of. Even if you change your career or interests in the coming years I am sure it will be something you will count as an advantage. \n\nI do not know very much about the Belgium school system but if it is anything like Canada\u2019s I am guessing there are career counsellors and advisors. Please consider connecting with them. I myself work in a field very different from which I trained. That is one of the benefits of being a younger person right now  - there is so much more flexibility in the job market. I\u2019d like you to consider that though your friends might have their hearts in the right place, that their words do matter. It clearly affected you enough that you mentioned it here. If they continue to mention it you should feel empowered to tell them that their statements are not a productive way to frame your current life. Just a thought for you to consider. \n\nRegarding your age/the passage of time: Maybe instead of thinking of the \u201ctime heals all wounds narrative\u201d which isn\u2019t necessary true, instead think of \u201ctime reveals all.\u201d  Your young age is a source of potential. Not all things heal with time - some things take work - self work or work with a professional. I just want you to know that from my outsider perspective you have so much ahead of you even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. \n\nI am curious - are you an American, Canadian or other?  I ask as I know that there are very different pressures in different education systems and cultures. I\u2019m so sorry to hear about what you are going through. Your friends\u2019 comments that you are \u201cthrowing your life away\u201d are not helpful and are unkind. Your life has value regardless of the things you do. \n\nSometimes relationships can be unhealthy in a co-dependent sense (or controlling) but sometimes without going that far one person in a relationship can begin to occupy the role of decision maker and even dictate expectations of how the other feels and acts. It is completely understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed after your relationship which sounds intense even though it was short. \n\nI think you should give yourself permission to figure out what you want and who you are. It may be true that you are no longer your former self, but maybe that is ok. One thing is for certain, you are very young (you may not want to hear that, but it is true). There are two important things to take in mind regarding your age - as you continue through school and into the working world your life will change dramatically and you will meet so many new people and experience new situations. This will help you develop your sense of self. Secondly, this relationship is but one in a long line of opportunities to meet someone who is right for you. You now know that you need a partner who sees you as an equal and looks out for your emotional well being. This is such a great thing to learn about what works for you. \n\nI also want you to consider that you may be experiencing depression. I cannot diagnose, but an inability to engage with things you previously valued and the comments your friends made may be a sign that your self perception and behaviour has changed, even if we disagree with the sentiments they shared. Maybe consider talking to the counselling service at your school or your GP to see if you can find affordable help. Even a single session may help. \n\nLastly, the world is filled with many wonderful shy people. The way you want to interact with the world is perfectly acceptable.

For example, my gf came from a household where when they have arguments, they just completely shut down and they dont talk to each other what so ever, but then without having talked about the issue by the next day they are already talking to each other as if nothing every happened. This contrasted with what I was used to in my household when it came to conflict resolution because in my household whenever conflicts arose my family and I discuss them and pour out our feeling to one another, and once were done working it out, things would go back to normal. So, when my gf and I would get into an argument I would try to talk about it to her, but she would just shut down and this would lead to more arguments but after realizing that we have different form of conflict resolution I talked to her openly about this and when he have an argument I let her shut down and when she is ready she will come talk to me to figure it out and talk it out.\n\nI mention conflict resolution as one of the \"habits\" but there are so many others, this is just one of the more important ones. Another example, might me that I like to eat breakfast at any time, but my gf simply cannot eat breakfast past 11 due to what was normal in her  family, usually something like this doesnt cause problems but due to her having her own habits and me having my own habits it can be troublesome depending on what topic it is. In the breakfast example, I know that I can still have breakfast with her so long as it is before 11 and any time after wards its a big no-no. \n\nBut yes just try to be more aware on each others differences when it comes to doing your own individual routines and how to have them work together in harmony\n\nAlso, its good to have space from one another from time to time because its not healthy to be constantly around your partner 100% of the time (but this advice more well know so not gonna go into detail). In regards to the constant fighting\n\nOkay this explains a lot. So when a couple moves in together and begin to cohabit, each person brings their own habits and routines. There tends to be a lot of arguments between couples for the first 2-5 years of living together because when your living together you try to do what was normal in your family and he does what is normal in his family.

You are going to basically have to be the father figure she needs and deserves and lay down strict rules and make her follow them.   I am no expert but i think she is having sex so she can feel loved.   As her father figure you are going to have to learn how to be a father to her by showing her love, imposing punishment when she does wrong,  and praising her when she does right.   Give her responsibilities to set up a structure where you can give her praise. When she does wrong ask her why she made that choice and counsel her on what she should have done.

For example, if fighting for the good Nintendo switch controler, then tell them. \"You guys have 5 minutes to come up with a reasonable and equitable agreement or I'll decide for you and will be bad for both. If you cry, insult, or hit each other then I'll intervene.\"\n\n2. If one hurt the other or made him cry do not punish the other rascal by sending to their room or spanking them. Rather investigate and make the culprit apologize and then make him do a restitution measure to the affected party (for example, since I saw you slapping your brother, you must apologize then take out the trash this week instead of him).\n\n3. If everything else fails, divide and conquer. Split them between you and my sister in law. You may need to resort to this if peace cannot be kept for long.\n\n\nKeep in mind private, keep your cool, kids often imitate adults when resolving problems, they will use the techniques they see you using, monkey see monkey do. If you yell when you loose your patience they will do the same. Also, keep the Monkeys busy, if they go idle or are bored they may start messing up with each other for fun or to reclaim your attention. Next, do not engage in physical punishment, repeat, do not engage. However you are free to do what you may see fit if they are in clear danger (like that time when they decided to throw knives at the pool). Last, do not let them see the fear in your eyes and remember you are the adult (when in doubt ask my sister in law, you are so lucky to have her). We are counting on you guys.

Your condition is actually pretty tame compared to other's they've seen. \n\nThat said, you also have to realize that if you're really scared you may act on these urges, the choice of getting treatment is only now or later. If you choose to be treated now, you will be allowed to have more control over how your treatment goe and be able to focus on your wellness in a more comfortable environment. If you put it off, you will be hospitalized for blood loss and/or infection after removing your eye. Then, it will also become apparent that the emergency was caused by mental illness. Then, you will be kept in a ward for a long time with little control of your treatment and in a much less comfortable environment. When you are released, you'll be stared at and asked an endless barrage of questions from everyone who wants to know what happened to your eye. \n\nIt's pretty clear what the right choice is. So seek help. Make a promise to yourself that if you ever get too close to acting on the urge, you'll go straight to the hospital, and keep that promise even after you begin treatment. Even when you can't see the point of it, keep that promise if for no other reason than to honor your word to yourself.

I regret nothing and still have very fond memories of the trip...\n\nOnly things you can really do is; constantly nag and annoy them about it... look up constantly holiday packages for \"long weekends\"... if you have bank / public holidays in your country where you get 4 days off, those can be great for a quick break to Spain / Greece etc... show them videos of the places and find a low cost place to go and be like... \"look\" we could all fly here next month for only \u20ac200 or something...\n\nuse skyscanner / kayak to compare flights, [lastminute.com](https://lastminute.com), [expedia.com](https://expedia.com) etc.\n\nAnother thing to think about is take an interest in what your parents enjoy to do.. maybe there are amazing places to go fishing... for example... places like Norway are beautiful for the nature, Iceland / Budapest / Germany have amazing spa's... or interesting places like Prague, Austria / France for skiing... the best way to catch a fly is with honey... not shit... as they say.", "\u201cLife teaches you how to live it, you just have to live long enough\u201d, you matter and I care about you.

But I do hope that if you really think it's worth staying with, you can do so while recognizing that humans are fallible and very good at coming up with arbitrary rules. \n\nYour sex drive is part of your humanity. Masturbation and self-exploration is a beautiful thing. And quite frankly, it disgusts me that some people shame others for it. (And I never stopped the whole time I was a Christian. It just made so little sense to me that it could be sinful. How could something that hurt absolutely nobody, and that has so many health benefits, be a sin?) Let me start by saying that I became a Christian at about the start of high school and stayed one until about a year after college. So I didn't have the \"growing up in it\" experience that leaves so many people very bitter. But I do still feel a bit bitter, and I definitely empathize with \"bitter atheists\" more now. Especially because I went to a Christian 4-year college. You could say I was a very liberal Christian. For example, I never agreed that homosexuality was wrong. I believe strongly in women's rights. Things of that nature. I thought I could be an accepting, science-believing Christian even if that wasn't the norm. But attending a Christian college made me see all the stereotypical Christian hypocrisy I'd always heard about. Just people full of judgement, way too eager to bash someone for making the \"wrong\" choice or living a \"sinful\" lifestyle.\n\nWhat attracted me to Christianity was never the supernatural aspect. I could take or leave the idea of an almighty judge. What attracted me was the principle of being kind to others and fighting for people's rights. My agnostic and atheist friends cared more about real-world issues than my Christian school mates, who didn't mind being as nasty and judgemental as the deemed necessary to \"save\" people from a hypothetical future damnation. The worst part is, I can now see how I used to be cruel to people when I thought I was helping them spiritually. I felt free when I finally, slowly separated myself from the Christian title, because I no longer felt any guilt for being human. And it hurts me so bad to know that so many other people continue to live in shame of their humanity, staying in a religion that wants them to be repressed. And to ignore their mental health (and in some cases their physical health too. You hear plenty of instances where believers choose prayer over doctors). All because it's traditional, and because controlling people with lists of moral rights and wrongs makes them more eager to give their money to the church. Because \"give money to the church\" is an easy way to be morally right.\n\nI know that last part sounds very cynical, but that's because I've grown cynical. In my 10 years, I never settled on a church because they all came across as money-grubbing. Your sex drive is perfectly normal, and masturbation is an amazing and wonderful thing for all people. I was a Christian for about 10 years, and dropped that after a long inner-battle with myself, after realizing how wrong it all was. Religious institutions really do thrive on controlling you with shame.", "Drinking protein helps but working out May increase your appetite since it\u2019ll increase your metabolism and help with your depression.

Just don\u2019t forget to stay hydrated tho!", "In my experience, college was a much different environment than high school.  I didn't hate high school, but I didn't love it either.  I loved college though.  I studied something I was super passionate about and I loved all of my professors.  Some of the most amazing people I've ever met are people I met at school, and to be perfectly honest, I'd go back in a heart beat if I could.  \n\nThat being said, college is definitely not for everybody, and that's ok.  I'm privileged enough that college wasn't a very big financial burden on me, which makes a huge difference, and I don't know if I'd feel the same if I had to put myself in massive amounts of debt for it.  Even beyond just the financial part, college is just simply not a good fit for some people.  Sometimes it makes more sense to skip college and move on to something else.  \n\nHow would you be paying for college?  Would it be a huge financial burden, or would you be able to come out of it without too much debt (if any)?  I'd say look at schools and programs that you think might be a good fit (and that might alleviate some of the things you hate about school now), and consider applying to them.  There's no harm in just applying.  If you get in and think you want to take the risk, go for it (as long as it wouldn't cripple you financially, as I said before).  You might love it.  And if you hate it, that's ok too.  Luckily, you'd know pretty early on in the college process whether or not you'll like it.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to be successful without college.  Trade schools, freelancing, volunteer programs, hell even the Peace Corps, if you're into that.  Maybe look into alternate paths while you're considering college.

It looks like currently you are having major challenges in your life... and I know saying that that it is an understatement, on top of all your past traumatic personal experiences and relationships. But I want you to know that I deeply sympathize with all that you have gone through and experienced, and I am faithful things will get better for you. It sounds like you are a good and strong person, and for everything that you have endured to being the age you are now, I am confident you will find the light at the end of the tunnel, and seize the hope and the joy for your life that you deserve.\n\nNow, I'm no psychologist, but there are several ways I believe that can help you with tackling these issues. They are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Journaling/Keeping a Diary**. It helps to write out all the thoughts, experiences, and feelings that you have had or currently have. Even if you feel that you cannot or are not ready to reveal your traumatic experiences or its details, journaling, or just writing occasionally, is a good, cathartic way to voice out any stress that you are feeling, and to be your own therapist. Plus, it helps you organize your thoughts and even plan on how to possibly solve them. At the very least, your thoughts won't be swimming around in your mind haphazardly, so at least there will be some order for your mind.\n* **Understand Your Value**. It is helpful to understand both what you mean to your friends and family in your life. Understand that your parents and loved ones are worried for you and they wouldn't want to see you suffering like this. Understand that you're a being worthy of love and respect, and those who have assaulted you in the past were wrong to do so. You are young and you still have a lot of potential, I strongly believe in that. You have the potential to both become an influence for others who have gone through similar experiences as yours and you have the potential to become a success in your own right and not have this horrible experience limit you as a person. Being the age you are now and living through to write your tale shows me that you are stronger than you know to be, and I am confident that you will prevail.\n* **Know You're Not Alone**: It can be easy to feel great shame and embarrassment to tell others that you were a victim of sexual assaults. However, I think that is a mistake. Telling someone what you have experienced is a good way to build a relationship and to heal from the horrific experience. Of course, I know you may not want to burden some people or feel you are doing that to them, nor do you wish to create an awkward scene, so I understand you would not divulge this experience to anyone who you may meet. But do at least understand that you're not alone and there are people out there who have gone through what you have. That being said, it is a good idea to join groups, advocacy and support, to feel as part of a community and to have a feeling with of solidarity, to let you know that you are there for others just as well as others are for you. It is worth it.\n* **Try Seeking Out the Right Support**: In times of great stress, turmoil, and personal suffering, it can be hard to know who to really turn to. You mentioned how your grandma was dying at the time you were in a new relationship with a man, only to be rebuffed and dismissed by him. Unfortunately, sometimes you can only understand who is really worthy of your time through trial and error, and by no means am I discouraging you from further getting intimate with someone to talk about what you're going through, but I think it would be helpful to talk to support groups instead, because at least you will be with those who have common experiences and who will be less likely to judge and dismiss you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, these are all my thoughts on the matter. There might be more advice than what I could give, of course, but I believe these are ways to really help. I'm not really an expert writer, though I would like to improve, for sure. But I sincerely believe that you have the power to change and to overcome. Starting here, on Reddit, shows that you have taken the initiative to solve your problems and reach out, and though you may be anonymous, you have at least still taken the first step. And, from what you have told me, being the age you are now and recognizing who has mistreated you and assaulted you in the past, to doing your best to appear strong despite those whom you have lost, tells me just what a resilient person you are, and how you're growing smarter and wiser to improve your life. You just need to keep the momentum up and to realize, most importantly, that you are a person who has value and that you are not alone. Keep those thoughts in your mind, have the courage to both seek help whether personally or privately, and to reach out to others when they are troubled or feeling the same. I promise you that your kindness and love will pay dividends twofold as you continue your life's journey.", "I don't know the first thing about being a trans guy.

First off half of the things we went through is my fault because I have been a compulsive liar since elementary school ( which is why I need to find therapy ). And I bury myself with guilt so with my mothers complaints about me of whatever she doesn\u2019t agree with , I just take it and don\u2019t say anything because I feel I deserve it. I watched videos about compulsive lying and I see I have to just forgive myself and move on but I can\u2019t stop lying everyday, I lose relationships because of the lying and not because I get caught but bc I just can\u2019t be around that person knowing I\u2019m doing wrong.

She wants me to be open and tell her everything and I honestly don\u2019t want to because everything is extreme with her. She can be physical with me when she gets easily angry and I\u2019m just calm. I just take it. Some examples is She chooses what I wear (sometimes) and MAKES me wear it, wants to know everyone I know, where I\u2019m at always, walks me to wherever I may go, correct me constantly when I say some word wrong, makes a lecture out of everything even when it\u2019s 2am and it\u2019s time for bed and literally judged the SHIT out of me when I came out as trans ( in high school I thought I wanted transition to male ) and said \u201cno one would date you\u201d. And even when I want to just cross dress for fun she keeps bringing up me being a boy .. when she found out I got in trouble with someone I let use my account to put there money in and it was someone I was seeing, they scammed me. She punched and kicked me and tried to beat me with metal. So extreme smh. if I don\u2019t like something or she gets the feeling of it then she is ready to kick me out or have me pay rent when I\u2019m literally a full time college student. She may even bring up \u201cI really don\u2019t give a shit\u201d about my mental illness ( my manic depression and anxiety ) and make it about her ALWAYS somehow. I know my mom is human and all but as I get older I feel so dissociative and more cold with her. I just feel like I do everything for her because that\u2019s what a child is SUPPOSE to do. But deep down, everything she has done for me brought me where I am now but still.. I don\u2019t feel I could say \u201c I love you\u201d. I don\u2019t say it back to her tbh and it makes me feel worse. Especially knowing when she passes away she would never know all the stories I told her are false and literally her own daughter is a disappointment.

It's always harder than you think it will be. It was for me. My best furry friend Sammy passed 4 years ago this month. I was devastated. In many ways, I still am. I had him for 15 years. I was able to adopt him from a family who's son was abusive to him and they were going to get rid of him because they just didn't want him. He was not even a year old when I got him. Instantly we bonded. I was always patient with him and let him come to me and I would sing the James Taylor song: \"You've got a friend\" to him while he sat in my lap. We bonded completely. He was always around me when I was home and would sleep on my bed at night and be right outside my door in the morning when I got up. He was a large and fluffy tabby Maine Coon and I loved him dearly. \n\nOver the course of us moving to seven different places he wasn't happy about a new environment but he adjusted well considering. We got him a pal who was also a Maine Coon about a year after we got him. I simply adored him. We were so in tune that after a few years I could get him to come to me without saying a word. All he ever wanted was to be with me. I have gone through a lot of ups and downs over the years and whenever I was sad or having a tough time, he would just show up next to me. He didn't get in my face or invade my space. He would just be next to me. He knew exactly what I needed without me even knowing it. He, like your furry friend was my unofficial therapy animal. I didn't know how much he really meant to me until he was gone. He got cancer about 4 years ago and I saw his decline and it hurt. The vet recommended that I have him put down but I just couldn't. He was terrified of riding in cars and I just couldn't let his last memory be of a scary car ride and dying on a cold, metal table. He lived another six months with me and breathed his last right in my arms. I know he suffered more and I have a hug amount of guilt from it. But all he ever wanted was to be with me and I just didn't have the heart to deny him that. As he got worse he lost his sight and hearing but he would still purr and sit with me so I knew he still wanted to live. At least that's what I felt. \n\nTo this day I still cry about him when a memory hits me. I can still remember his scent also. His big paws and his fluffy mane. The way he always had to be right next to my face so he could rub the ridge of his nose on my chin. God I miss him. I made a picture tribute to him a few months after he died but I've only been able to sit through it once. It's still hard. I buried him right under our bedroom window outside and I got a solar lantern to mark his grave. When I go outside at night it shines bright and reminds me that even though he's gone, he was a light in my darkest times. His memory is like that to me now. Through all the pain and crying (I don't cry often at all) and sadness his light still shines through the memories of the happiness he gave me. I'm sorry if this isn't much by way of advice. I guess I'm not really good at it. I just know how it feels. It feels like I buried a part of me I will never get back. I have to go on though as best as I can. If I don't then it would be against everything he ever did for me. The pain is temporary but the joy he gave me is something that can never fade.

And being closer to the kitchen might be more convenient but wouldn\u2019t solve that particular problem. \n\nWith regard to variety, yes, the college specialist should have checked in more detail, but the onus was on you as well to ask for and get specific details of what meals and how much variety would be available to you from the dining hall. It\u2019s quite hard to cook for someone with so many allergies and reasonable accommodation doesn\u2019t mean effectively providing you with a personal chef. You are a better expert on what foods you like and what meal ideas or combos would work for you than the college staff are, you\u2019re the one that\u2019s experienced and lived with your allergies all your life. You need to help them help you. \n\nI think you can try the things others suggested here, and also maybe ask to meet directly with the head of the kitchen staff and see if you can work out together a larger menu of meals that both would fit your needs and that they are able to provide within their constraints.\n\nIf none of that works, given the disability woman has already accepted some responsibility for the situation and suggested the best option might be for you to move, then it seems at least if you decide to do that they will be reasonable with refunding you the dorm and meal plan costs you\u2019ve paid. Ok but I presume you\u2019re not paying 50K for the dorm and food plan, most of that is tuition. Plus I\u2019m not seeing where they\u2019ve fallen short of what they promised you. They have food available for you to eat but you don\u2019t like that there isn\u2019t enough variety or you feel it\u2019s not nutritious.  They haven\u2019t promised you\u2019d have food to eat and then not given you any. If you have particular suggestions of meals they could make for you, have you tried speaking to them and asking for those? You\u2019re better placed to identify what you can eat than they are.

Well, did they promise you you\u2019d have X number of meal options available? It\u2019s hard to provide variety with a diet as restrictive as yours, when you\u2019re also trying to feed 100\u2019s of other people. And in a large commercial kitchen used to make 1000\u2019s of meals a day, yes there will be a risk of cross contamination of food you are allergic to. They can\u2019t fully deepclean and disinfect the kitchen every time you want to cook. Well if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m sure if you explain the situation you can get a pro-rata refund of what you\u2019ve paid. It\u2019s just as much hassle for them to have you there as it is for you. It really sounds like your own private kitchen in an apartment  is best solution you could have. You\u2019d have total control of making sure it\u2019s clean and not contaminated to your standards and buy and cook whatever you want the way you want it.

You both feel sorrow, grief, anger, sadness, pain, and a great deal of other things.

I relate. :/ I used to just barf my interests at the expense of conversation and listening to others. And I was one of those grammar Nazis that would correct people... Just thinking about it makes me cringe so hard. Anyway. \n\nI\u2019ve found that people love to talk about themselves. Ask about what they\u2019re interested in. Favorite movies, games, hobbies, etc. Listen to them. Find common ground. And in return, share what you\u2019re passionate about too. \n\nI think it\u2019s the curse of the gifted kid to think we need to be masters of everything before we\u2019re equipped to talk about it or do it. Listen. You don\u2019t have to be an expert in games, movies, etc to talk about them. It\u2019s okay to not be the most informed or intellectual person in the room. I think being pegged as the \u201cgifted/super smart\u201d kid puts so much pressure on a person. I mean by design it\u2019s isolating, right? It\u2019s putting you on a pedestal and it can intimidate others and make it equally hard for a \u201cregular kid\u201d to form a connection with you (in a school setting).\n\nFeeling the pressure to demonstrate we\u2019re smart/intellectual/well informed almost becomes part of our identity. If we don\u2019t prove it, we lose a sense of who we are, especially since it was embedded in us in our formative years.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s enough barfing armchair psych. It\u2019s stuff I\u2019ve noticed in myself. I had to shed the identity and pressure of being \u201cthat smart kid\u201d and be willing to relax and explore other aspects of myself, interests, etc in order to connect with folks. \n\nIt\u2019s awesome that you\u2019re branching out into new stuff. But it\u2019s saddening that you\u2019re abandoning your interests and don\u2019t talk about them anymore. You don\u2019t have to hide or deny that aspect of yourself to connect to people. When you talk about it, just be cognizant of the other person\u2019s reaction. Give em time to talk and share their own knowledge or questions or observations. \n\nAlso, know when\u2019s the right time to talk about these things. I dunno what your interests are, but for example \u2014 when I go to art museums with a friend and see a painting or style I recognize, I\u2019ll talk about it (sometimes at great length, sometimes not). In that case it\u2019s relevant, and people unfamiliar with the subject often appreciate the insight. So there\u2019s absolutely still opportunities to talk about what you love. It sounds like you\u2019re socially aware and recognize when too much is too much. \n\nAlso... read the room/person. Some friends will have the same interests as you or love to talk intensely about what they like as well, debate, and so on. Others not so much. Love them all for who they are, and don\u2019t dismiss anybody before you actually get to know them. :) \n\nTherapy helps a lot for sure. It\u2019s awesome that you\u2019re self aware and want to change. That\u2019s the first step. Don\u2019t beat yourself up too much \u2014 it\u2019s hard, but try to see those \u201ccringe\u201d experiences as lessons. You learn from each one. It\u2019s a day by day thing to change old behavior. There will be times where you do something \u201ccringy\u201d but don\u2019t give up. \n\nGood luck!!", "Thank you!

It\u2019s been 10 years since I lost my 18 year old son, Aaron. I completely lost my known worldview that day, and it has taken a while to rebuild, an older, wiser worldview for myself.\n\nMake sure to grieve the loss of future. In my case, Aaron was the only one of my 3 children who liked children and presumed he\u2019d have his own. A lot of his friends, who I have FB contact with still, have matured, got married, and had children. It is very possible I will not have grand children, and I am okay with that and at the same time there is grief around that knowing.\n\nAlso grieve the loss of the self you knew too. I am married to a widower, and he still will sometimes say, \u201cI use to be so\u2026..\u201d I say it to myself sometimes too. I have come to believe it is a kind of self cruelty to compare yourself to who you use to be. Especially if it is something you miss about yourself. A naive quality you can\u2019t get back.\n\nStop seeing emotional pain as a negative. That is cultural programming. A great disservice to to humanity, and made all the worse by the popular media. If I am triggered to remember my son, I feel so many things at once. I miss him, but I also feel my love for him. I cry, but I am happy to experience a memory of who he was, or what he appreciated. I don\u2019t want to be comforted anymore, because nothing is wrong. I can let the grief go through me, and not have it be me, or define me.\n\nI think how long it takes to heal depends so much on what else is going on in your life. I was still raising a daughter, and two, unhappy step daughters when Aaron died, so life was very difficult for quite a few years after. So my healing was delayed and derailed on many levels.\n\nIf you need counselling, get it. I was in counselling for several years after Aaron\u2019s death, just so I could navigate the rest of my complicated life. I developed PTSD, but that is mostly faded, only some triggers for that exist. I had counselling for that too. Be kind to yourself. I found the shock of my son\u2019s sudden death really messed with my cognitive abilities. It has taken years to get better. I use to have a mind like a steel trap, and now I still struggle to focus on accounting, I still forget words, or have trouble formulating more complex thought.\n\nSince Aaron\u2019s death, I have not been able to work full time. Initially I couldn\u2019t commute for my job because I would have melt downs on the highway. After a medical leave, I went back to work, I physically become disabled every time I try to. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia a couple of years after Aaron\u2019s death. A condition I probably had before, but not enough to interfere with my lifestyle. Exhaustion has been plaguing me for years. So I have also had to grieve the loss of my financial independence and personal economic power. I lost my career just was I was feeling like, I was on my way.\n\nIf I am going to be completely honest here, Alcohol made the journey more difficult, and probably take longer than it should have for both me and my husband. My son\u2019s death triggered his grief process, over losing his wife and their carefully planned life. I broke away first, and had to leave my husband before he also finally chose sobriety. We are now back together. So avoid drinking altogether if you have a tendency to use it daily, or for a coping mechanism.\n\nI have learned that all forms of grief seems to be magnified, once you have experience that deep soul level disruption.\n\nI am getting stronger, physically and emotionally, finally. There are no kids living at home anymore. We moved to a smaller house, and live on an island. Simplifying life was a must for me/us. I don\u2019t really regret or mind any of the changes. Like I said, you get a new worldview, new priorities, and they become a part of you.\n\nI found this quote, I really felt explained things for me;\n\n\u201cHis absence goes through me like thread through a needle and everything I do is stitched with its color.\u201d\n\nSo I live life to make sure, I choose bright and lively colours now.", "That is clearly not the case, he\u2019s upset from the breakup and has nowhere to go and doesn\u2019t know what to do from here.

Yeah, you'll know when you feel love for them, it honestly feels really weird to me that I now feel a tiny bit of love for my mum.\n\nOk, where can I get one of those cheeseburger guns, I need one. I think your definitively more evil than me now, lool! I think what you grew up seeing your entire life has subconsciously made you block your feelings to protect yourself, because the less you care or feel, the less you get hurt from things. At least that's how I am because of how I was treated almost my entire life. Also I suspect you learnt from a young age that words are just words. You learnt that when your mum's ex bf always said \"I love you\" but then he was violent to her. You don't hurt the people you love and I feel for your mum because it must have really messed with her mind to be hurt one second and then being shown affection the next by the same person. I learnt that the word \"sorry\" is just an empty word. I was told it a million times as a kid, was shown love and then I was hurt again on repeat. It's actions that matter and really show what a person is like. You also said you never felt love for your family, I'm the same. I never ever felt love for my family (apart from my brother), even before I became apathetic, because I had a lot of resentment towards them. It's actually only this year I've forgiven the past and now I'm starting to feel a tiny spark of love for my mum and dad because everything is ok now.\n\nHaha, ok well we will start by invading my home country, the UK. Same, even though I will always be there for someone who comes to me with their problems, I still find myself not really feeling anything inside no matter how much I want too. I'm not sure if it's a self defence mechanism actually? Because when I think about it, it's a very vulnerable situation when someone comes up to you and vents or cries, it's expected to feel sympathy and sadness towards them. I've noticed in the past I freeze up and numb every emotion until I'm literally empty inside so then I don't become vulnerable myself, even though I'm completely calm on the outside. I don't fake that I care and want to support them, because that's real, but I realise I sometimes fake that I'm feeling something towards them and their problem.\n\nWell, if we're doppelg\u00e4ngers then maybe both of us are just as evil as each other. I think we should team up and take over the world together, haha. Are you me? Literally had the same upbringing apart from it was actually happening to me and it stopped when I was 17 too! I'm 20 now. I've never wanted a relationship and don't feel like I'm capable of being in one because I have a fear of being emotionally attached to someone and feeling love, but I'm actually really content with being single my entire life. I don't know if this helps but just from my own experience, you could be apathetic? I became apathetic when I was 17. I still feel every emotion but just not strongly, their very dull and sometimes I'm just numb but I'm still a very caring person and care about others. Do you feel like this at all?", "Same.

If the plot doesn\u2019t interest you but it interests a lot of people (or vice versa) then don\u2019t be peer pressured into reading something you don\u2019t really care about.

Your friends should not be upset with you being friends with the other girl at least. They are not in control of who you make friends with. However, it might not be right of them to be upset at you for going out with the other girl, but it can be normal. Best thing for you to do, be friends with both of them and get to know them first. Just because you like both of the girls doesn't mean one girl is a backup. Treat them both equally, and treat them like friends. Whoever you feel more connected to, try to build a relationship but do not neglect the other girl. Keep it balanced, and don't keep it a secret that you're friends with the other girl to any of them. If you get in a relationship with one of them, and they find out you were friends with the other girl, things might go bad. It's best to be honest and balanced, and treat them like friends.", "Thanks for heliping /u/Quitmaaa. I feel like that's the best decision. Joe has also never made me pick between him or my friends, so I think it'll probably be the better choice in the long run, even if its sad to lose Jane now. I told him about it as soon as the phone call ended. He was really upset since he didn't think anything that happened that night was assault. He and I understand that from her perspective she may have felt pressured by her friend and think that she may be shifting the blame from her friend to him to make it easier to handle.\n\nEdit: I don't mean to downplay the seriousness of sexual assault or the frequency it occurs, I just don't want to make a snap judgement on a situation I wasn't in or objectively know 100% of what happened. Thank you, this helped. I agree that the ultimatum is a pretty bad move.\n\nI'm mostly concerned that if what happened is as serious as she's making it out to be, and that if really seems to be suffering from remembering it, that she might have PTSD?

Best of luck.", "Aha, I think I better understand the pain you feel. Or pains.\n\nI guess maybe you want her to stop because its painful to you, and because  you want good things instead of bad for her. It looks to me like she is acting selfish, saying she doesn't care what happens to the wife. I guess you don't want her to act like that. You wish she would have empathy for someone who is in the same situation she once was, and change her behavior.\n\nMaybe you can get help, talk with someone about how you feel, and what you can do about... about yourself? Your feelings are important, and they belong to you. So what can you do for yourself?\n\nYou can also ask yourself what you can do for Mom, what you want to do. Do the two of you talk about how your father's leaving affected you / the family? Does that help, or if you haven't done it, do you think it might? You're welcome. I hope you have a nice, calm day. Tell Mom I said hi. ;-) I'm sorry. I know this is difficult for you.\n\nI don't know if this is any help, but have you considered what you can or might do? More importantly, *why?* Is there some way you feel obligated to... do something? It's just that it's her life, and his life. Do you think you should direct their lives? Make them do something? The reason I hope this can help: defining what you want can be a big help. Seeing whether or not you have any part in something can be even more important.\n\nYou know some information. Other than that, how are you involved? Are they meeting in your home? Do they demand that you make hotel or restaurant reservations for them? Do you drive your mother to these meetings?\n\nNow that you made your opinions clear, is that all you wanted?\n\nYou really want her to stop, don't you? Will you try to force her? Is that your responsibility?\n\nI guess the upshot of all this is this: is it any of your business? Because if it's not, your decision can be to do nothing, and hope the best for everyone.

These days I am more chaotic good and am learning to adjust my guilt and make peace with my brief stint into evilness.  Stay strong.  Don't let the bastards get you down.", "I can't give you a solution, but I want you to know that you're not alone. I'm in the exact same position (maybe worse as I failed uni now after 3 years of \"kinda\" trying). And I'm really feeling it now as well with summer break ending.\n\nI think it's important to make sure that you aren't depressed or anything like that that could cause you being unmotivated. Now if you're certain that's not it, you can try any of the following things if you wish (can't say for sure that it'll help, I'm only starting to do them slowly) This is nothing concrete as what your next steps should be, but just some tips to figure things out in life.\n\n\\- Exercise, preferably outdoors: To be honest I was getting tired of everybody saying exercise will solve everything, but I think I now understand why everybody is preaching about it. Although it won't suddenly solve all your problems or give you sudden motivation for life or anything, it can definetly help with clearing your mind and sorting out all your thoughts. Cardio, especially running works best for me. After a 25min jog I feel like i can take on the world, and you know what it does give me a sudden motivation and confidence. Though can't lie this euphoric effect does wear off quite soon. But the 'mind clearing' does help with finding out what you want and how you feel when the usual thoughts and noise get pushed aside. I'd say outdoors works for me best, as lloking at the sky on a clear day gets me motivated for really anything..\n\n\\- Learning something new with a clear goal and deadline in mind: This is really applicable to a lot of things. Learning something new can never be waste of time, cause well you're learning. Now this can go from academics to creative skills like drawing, playing a new instrument etc... If you go for something more academical, it will potentially help you get used to learning/studying if you ever wish to return to uni. Or you know learning a new language can only open doors for you. Now the goal and 'deadline' part. For unmotivated people building a routine is really the only way to not lose ourselves on our journey through life. Because your motivation just slowly disappears or wasn't there from the beginning, it can be hard to maintain a workflow(or any flow) to get to a set goal. Essentially this would just be a trial of sorts for any real work/life situations were you end up being unmotivated or uninterested but bite through because you set yourself a goal and not even you yourself can stop you from completing this goal. Same for deadline, just to get used to deadlines in the working world.\n\n\\- Travel/Exploring: people preach a lot about traveling and stuff, and i agree to a certain degree. you don't need to \"get out of the country\" to travel, heck you don't even need to leave your city/town. But you have to leave the boundary of places you already know. In essence you need to explore a place you have never been to before.Yeah you might pass that street on the right every day, but have you ever seen whats beyond? any side road that you know is there but have actually never seen or walked through? You should think of it as a rpg game where behind every tree or bush their might be a chest for you to loot. Okay that's probably a bit extreme, but to just walk/bike/run someplace you haven't been before can really open up your mind. But if you can afford to go for a hike on a mountain/forest/anything nature really, I would definitely recommend it. As cheesy as it sounds, it might end up being a journey to find yourself or even a piece of yourself.\n\nSorry for the text wall, I think the most important part is figuring out if you aren't depressed or anything like that, as long as you're healthy in mind and body life will be fine.

Most first-year students are worried about making friends, and they'll jump at the opportunity to make conversation and spend time with others. \n\nTo meet the most people, I highly recommend living in residence. You'll get to meet your roommate(s), and your floor/house will have a ton of orientation-week activities that will give you tons of chances to talk to people. O-week is one of the best weeks because there'll be a million activities to participate in. Find a group that seems friendly, or find a person who seems to be alone, and strike up a conversation. \n\nAnd if you don't meet friends in residence, you'll still have a million opportunities. You can join a club, and meet people with similar interests; or see if your program has an orientation meeting, or a Facebook group, or a groupchat, and join that; or sit next to someone on your first day of class and talk to them. Or all of the above! Most peope are looking for the chance to meet people and make friends.\n\nYou'll also have a ton of things to talk about! You can ask people what their program is, how long the program is, where they're from, what their hobbies are, what classes they have... the list is never-ending. And if you're worried about carrying the conversation, or trying to organize times to hang out with people, then I recommend trying to find a friendly extrovert, and they'll be extremely helpful in keeping a conversation going and faciliting social opportunities. They'll also probably be able to widen your social circle by introducing you to some of the other people they've met\n\nYou've got this, OP. Good luck, and enjoy your first year!", "That\u2019s good.

Calling someone a name in the middle of a fight doesn\u2019t make you abusive. Even super good and chill people get angry and lose their temper. \n\nIf you\u2019re not in a relationship now, and you\u2019re in a good place.

This isn\u2019t \u201cex boyfriend who she is still in love with\u201d this is \u201cdude that is around a lot that she fucked for a while\u201d \n\n2nd tier: many of the other behaviours from both of you are very troubling and point towards a deeply unhealthy dynamic. It is clear you both have very serious trust problems. You shouldn\u2019t be looking through her social media, and she shouldn\u2019t be listening in on your phone calls. You both come across as people who are insecure and perhaps inexperienced in relationships. \n\nMy advice is that neither of you should be dating anyone until you address your insecurities and trust issues.

Please don't make yourself and your husband miserable It's not selfish to decline marrying someone you don't want to. It's your life. I understand non-western cultures often view this differently tho That's no true. There is someone for everyone and you can always work on yourself if that is the issue Your wife will be able to tell. You're cutting yourself and your future wife off from having a loving relationship (which is something most people need to be happy) for no good reason If this is even. First of all you should only marry for love in my opinion, any other reason is a bad one and will end badly.

I am also 26f and am very far from what I considered an \u2018adult\u2019 to be when I was a kid. And to be honest accepting that this is what being an adult means for me has been largely liberating. I draw manga and watch anime also, spend my evenings playing video games when I can and can chat to a 10-year-old like we are best friends. On the other hand I also have a career in design / engineering that I work very hard on, bills to pay like you and a house and relationships to maintain. It doesn\u2019t have to be one or the other and if someone thinks that, it is their own problem to solve. \n\nI would say think about where that definition of adulthood comes from. Were you pressured to be mature from a young age? Or maybe behind the facade of a normal family there were hints of abuse that have been normalized in your mind. Whatever it is, a good way out of it is to chase it down and find out more about it. Get to know yourself a step at a time, including all the scary things you may not want to talk about - actually, especially those. \n\nI came to the conclusion that I am the problem too when I moved to the UK to study and things were exactly the same as before, because I was the same. But instead of hating myself like I always did I decided to find help and learn to be myself with no fear or regret. Still working on it of course and very far off where I would want to be but let me tell you, it changed my life. \n\nBy all means if you want to talk about this more, message me and we can discuss - I am new here also so I hope there is a messaging function to this forum and I am not talking crap. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "I'd say sleep now because you're going to end up feeling like shit if you dont.

So I took an ice pack to work, I started icing my hands probably every 30 minutes for a few minutes at a time, boss was very flexible with this. Eventually I did it less and less. At some point, you don't need ice, instead just run your hands under cold water on the sink!  I still do it to this day out of habit even though I hardly need to.\n#2 This one's huge-Mouse position.  I'm sure you've tried every ergonomic mouse under the blue sun to alleviate your pain. You know what one ended up being the best?  The absolute basic $5 flat mouse.  Why?  Use your THUMB to left click!  Your other fingers, close them as if you're going to make a fist, you don't actually need them. It feels strange and awkward at first but you get used to it really quick.  The problem is, if you have an open hand, even if you're not clicking with the fingers, just having them open even hovering over the mouse will aggravate the tendons after a while.  Closing your fingers is if going to make a fist, uses those tendons at the top of your hands a lot less.  This will not instantly fix your problem but it helps a great deal.  Oh and DO NOT use the wrist pads!\n#3  One finger typing.  I think you called it peck typing.  Do not underestimate this.  Of course you feel like you're in elementary but it gets the job done.  If you do it right, you lessen the strain on your tendons immensely.  Remember your tendons on the top of your hands are getting inflamed every time you raise your fingers.  With one finger typing, if you do it right, you won't raise your fingers as much,\n#4 If you're like me and you generally hold the wheel with your left hand on the bottom left corner of the wheel, you are hurting your wrist. Instead with your left hand hold the wheel at the top center, this lessens the bend in your wrist as much as possible, although not perfectly.  Also, be aware when you turn the wheel, this is also aggravating your fingers.  No way around this but being aware of it helps.  Believe me you'll find ways to limit how much turning you're doing.\n#5 Last but not least, it's important to be aware that doing nothing, is surprisingly not helpful, you have to use your hands in some manner. Ever been using the computer with your mouse, surfing the web, and doing nothing with your left hand, and your left hand starts to get aggravated?? Why?  Because you're not doing anything with, and inflammation is building up.  Now of course, doing stuff can also aggravate your hands so it's important just to realize that you have to find a middle ground.  Taking a week or two off work, will not result and being all better if you did nothing with your hands.  I don't have exact advice for this, but just being aware of this fact is helpful.  Be mindful when you're doing things and you notice your hands feel good afterwards, do whichever task that was often!  For example, massaging your own forearms and hands is extremely helpful.  This actually should be tip #6, I do this to this day out of habit.  Massaging your own forearm and hands with your opposite hand actually relieves tension to the hand you're massaging, and keeps the blood flowing on the hand you're massaging with. At first you'll feel some pain on the hand you're massaging, but it's good pain, you're relieving tension.  You'll feel it less and less.  Oh and for the love of god, don't use stress balls!  They will mess up your forearms. =)", "I understand you\u2019re scared that\u2019s a sticky situation i deff don\u2019t think your mom wouldn\u2019t believe you .. but bring your best friend involved so y\u2019all can confront her just don\u2019t tell your parents you know how weird that\u2019s going to look .

I know how you feel though because when I was in high school I wanted to be with someone too. You probably see couples all around school and it just makes you wish you had something like that .

You\u2019ll never find the right person by being desperate to be with someone . It should happen naturally. When that person comes along , you\u2019ll know. Especially in high school.

They\u2019re extremely homophobic, so that was never an option for me.  I moved out when I was 18, and now I\u2019m pretty out and open now, but they still don\u2019t know.  I feel free, that I don\u2019t have to hide my sexuality anymore.  I can\u2019t tell you when is a good time to come out, because that\u2019s different for every person.  I think when the time is right for you, you\u2019ll be ready and you\u2019ll feel it.  I wish you the best of luck!", "I live in a similar situation as yours. My BF was raped. \n\nOne thing I learned is that talking is the key to everything here. Be open (even when he might not always be), be honest about your feelings (even when he feels you are not taking him seriously) and most importantly: just listen to what he says without being judgmental or venting your opinion. If you're unsure about what he wants from you, just ask him if he wants your advice or if he wants you to just listen. That usually works.\n\nSome things he will tell you much later than you would expect. This was your first step. He trusts you enough to tell you. Rape victims often feel shame or guilt. I know it sounds weird, but they often feel responsible for their own rape. You will be talking about these things in bits and pieces. Just listen... be compassionate, understanding, but when his feelings are irrational or off, calmly tell him. You will become his Anker when needed. He will need somebody to ground him. \n\nSome things you do (or don't do) can trigger him. Even with therapy and everything, some of the PTSD and depression stays. he will be triggered by things you do not expect, like a certain shade of colour or a smell or a sound or just by some words in  certain order in a sentence. It is a bit of a balance-act. You'll get the clues and learn how to mitigate them. Ask if needed, without over-asking. Let him talk, while you listen. You're both going to be just fine when you have trust. \n\nOne advice I can give when it comes to sex: you should not overthink. When there is trust, all is going to be fine. Even when you do something that triggers him, let it happen. Based on trust you will both manage. Just enjoy each other like you did before. Behave and act like before. You're biggest problem will be the thinking... just don't! He will notice and you both will not enjoy the sex. Be in the moment, not somewhere in the past or future... and keep talking.", "I had some of these in my life, and managed to get rid of every single one of them without having to be nasty. I told them that I had found Jesus, asked them to join me in worship and invited them to church...never saw or heard from them again.", "\"Unfortunately for reasons of personal health, I can no longer participate in X.\"\n\nDone. With the greeting and ending ofc", "&gt;human nature tends to believe that if someone is being too nice, they want or need something\n\napplies to humans in general.\n\n&gt; none of my friends go through the shit I go through \n\nnot a good way to judge yourself, they may be going through something worse why are you nice to everyone? human nature tends to believe that if someone is being too nice, they want or need something, that's how we have become. be nice to your friends and family not to random people. they may be going through their own shit which leads them to form opinions about you.\n\njust be normal, normal people are not nice to everyone. they are polite maybe.", "Okay yeah that's pretty weird. He's either so innocent he doesn't realize or he's a creep. I say block him at this point. Are they suggestive comments on your posts or just normal banter type stuff?", "My grandfather, who I loved more than anything and was like my father, had a daughter outside of his marriage to my grandmother. I knew about this daughter for 5-7 years before he told me. I chose not to tell because I valued my relationship with him more than anything. I think that\u2019s going to be what your decision comes down to. Is knowing worth losing something of your relationship with him? If no, let it go until he decided to tell you or not. Is yes, ask and understand you may be in for something(s) that you may not like. There\u2019s no delicate way to do it. You just need to prepare for the probable fallout. \n\nMy questions, ones you may want to ask yourself are: What good will knowing the answer do for you, your mom, and your dad? Why do you want to know? Anger? A feeling of having to do what is right? Do you want to forge some sort of relationship with this possible sister? Will your dad even tell you the truth? If it is the truth will you accept it or continue to think otherwise? \n\nI don\u2019t have much to say other then as a daughter of a father who...got around...making relationships with children that were \u201cleft behind\u201d can be rough.

Unless you signed something that said you have to be a part of the sorority for X amount of time, then you shouldn't have to return the badge. \n\nAlways, always, wait for it... ALWAYS read what you sign. This is probably one of the most basic rules to adulting because if you don't, you can really screw yourself over. Does not matter what everyone else thinks. What if they had snuck a clause in the paperwork that said if you quit, you owe X amount of money. You don't pay, they take you to court and the judge will not care that your didn't actually read what you signed because the point of signing is providing proof that you have read and agree to whatever terms have been detailed.

Did you even read what you signed?\n\nSounds like you need to just chalk this up as a learning experience, show a little maturity and return the property that doesn't belong to you. Besides, if you hate them *so* much, why keep the stupid badge? You're being petty. If you signed forms to join, depending on what you signed, it makes sense to sign forms to leave. It also makes complete sense to turn in your membership card so that you cannot misrepresent their organization. The badge... Depends on what the agreement was when you signed up. Is this some custom badge they put your name on that was meant to be a keepsake?

I am reminded of a colleague and a friend who was very attractive yet had a (female) manager tell her that she should dye her blonde hair brown and wear glasses in order \"to get ahead\" in our workplace.  She didn't say or do anything about it because of the power imbalance in play, but it bothers her to this day.  Post script:  my friend never took that advice and was very successful in her career. \n\nThinking back on my own experiences as a testosterone-fueled young male in the 60s and 70s, I had fantasies about my female teachers and professors, but that's where it stopped.  I don't think that would've changed even without the liberal clothing styles of the times.  Never did I think that my teachers didn't have something valuable to teach me and weren't due my utmost respect. \n\nThere's also the analogous situation of attempting to compliment the parent of an attractive child by saying, \"She's going to break a lot of hearts when she gets older,\" or some such drivel.  It's the same mindset that focuses on appearance instead of ability.  \n\nThat said, I've caught myself in the past thinking about someone in similar situations in the terms that you describe.

Become your own man. just like even in a marriage you will work, watch out for your kids, handle business, pay the bills etc and your wife is doing her own thing most of the time too taking care of the kids maybe goes to work goes to socialise or whatever. \n\nBut you need to tell her how it is. It's unnatural and toxic. People say goodbye, people leave, and some people might not communicate for a while because they are living their life. Work through it with her. \n\nIt's not love its selfishness. Love is 'i hope he has a good time I wish the best for him, I hope he doesn't get hurt' but she is thinking about how she herself wants your attention and she wants herself to feel better. Love is 'i haven't seen him for a day usually this means he is busy and productive I hope he is happy, some guys do drugs and abuse their girlfriends but he is being productive it's so great' see the difference? Love is 'its so great to see you I can't wait to spend time with you' selfishness is just focusing on how long you have been gone and what you should have done to give her more attention and how you didn't give her more affection etc. \n\nBig different between love and selfish infatuation", "Even though these things happened, realize that 9th grade is literally about becoming a FRESH.

You think people who understand CICO are \u201changry\u201d... that\u2019s just textbook fatlogic. Obviously you are a crusader for overeating and you think it\u2019s amazing or something. People who don\u2019t overeat or acknowledge that overeating is what causes you to become fat are the ones with some kind of defect... sure...\n\nIf you want to put aside the obvious facts of our CICO discussion and make this about you personally, which is a weird thing to want but okay, can you explain how you gained 50 pounds in a few months without overeating? Like how does the math work out on that one? Sounds like these people were basically born with superpowers if they can gain weight without eating more than they expend in activity...

I think it's key to understand the reason here.\n\nDoes she not wash her hair because she doesn't have the energy, for example because of depression, or another illness? For this we usually refer to what's called the 'spoon theory' - people without any health issues may have, for example, 25 spoons (units of energy) and people who do have a health issue may have 15, or 10, or sometimes as low as five. \nGetting dressed takes a spoon. Making breakfast takes a spoon. Eating breakfast takes a spoon. Heading to work takes a spoon. Work probably takes several spoons. I think you get where I'm going. In a situation like this, things like hygiene aren't a priority. Not because they're not important, but because they're not a matter of survival. Eating is. Working is. Et cetera. \nIn a situation like this, really all you can do is support her and try to get her all the help she can get (and wants - as someone with several chronic illnesses, a lot of your freedom can be taken away because caretakers are in your personal space so much) and realize that there are, fortunately, worse things in the world than smelly hair. \n\nOf course, there can also be another reason: I once had a friend who rarely washed her hair, because she had read that if you don't wash it for months, it'll develop some kind of self-cleaning-something-whatever. I do not know the details, I wasn't very interested in parttaking in her experiment, but for her, it was a reason not to wash her hair. \n\nConsidering embarassment - I'm not sure if there's a way to do this without embarassment, unfortunately. Perhaps you could do some kind of self care thing with face masks and hair masks, watch a movie - not make it necessarily about the hygiene, but more about being kind to yourself, taking care of your body, that stuff. It might help see her that it can be something enjoyable, because I definitely think there's at least some kind of element in here that is the reason she's not taking care of it. \n\nGetting really personal here, but it might be useful: I was molested as a young child, and abused for a very long part of my youth. Hygiene has been a major issue for me and sometimes still is, because for me when I wash myself, I struggle with depersonalisation, which is a fancy word to say 'my body doesn't feel like my body', or in my case, 'what is touching my body isn't me'. Sometimes even looking at myself in the mirror could confuse me because I wasn't able to recognize the person in the mirror. So please keep in mind that there might be trauma involved as well. It doesn't have to be, and I hope with all of my heart that it isn't.

If you find jogging to be peaceful and calming that\u2019s a good thing to do a lot of because it\u2019s an exercise that hits interest aswell.\n\nI might add that putting in sets and reps in your workouts will help a lot in keeping your workouts longer and working out the specified muscles better. By sets I mean how many times you will perform the workout. (Not to be confused with reps)\n\nFor instance: Pushups 10x3 (10 reps and 3 sets)\n\n                          Sit-ups 12x2( 12 reps and 2 sets)\n\nThese are random numbers but it gives a general idea of how you can work the desired muscles longer!\n\nHave fun!", "If she'd accept it, a lot of people who need help also need hygiene products (specifically, women need menstrual products).

Have a character with a dead family member they would be tempted to turncoat for, or have their body be used/wrecked by the magician so theres motivation for revenge. Consider that every character should have a specific motivation tied to the plot, not just general \"i want to save the world\".

I am not trying to be pessimistic, but the only solution I see is getting rid of the source of your depression/anxiety, which is him. You need to move out and have your own space, without him. I see that you can move out next year and until then, I recommend you to talk to him about this calmly and to make him realise how badly this situation has affected you. He should care as a brother and adjust himself, especially if he sees how serious you are. As another person stated in the comments, don't be aggressive or demanding when you ask him this, it will only trigger him more.

It can be helpful to have someone to talk to when going through difficulties.\n\nIf you go to a doctor, they may diagnose you with an anxiety disorder, and if they do they may prescribe medication (like an SSRI medicine). I've taken them before. They may also recommend that you see a therapist or another type of trained professional, because while medication is found to help many people, treatment is found to be more effective when medication is also combined with a therapy, like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) for example.\n\nYou can also go directly to a therapist/counselor if you want to try something else before taking medication. That could be helpful - they are trained to help people and can guide you through understanding what things cause your anxiety, and possible ways that you could cope with it, overcome it, and become the person that you want to be (potentially).\n\nI've personally taken medications for mental health conditions (I've had a few), and some have helped. I've also gone to therapy, and sometimes it has been helpful too. My personal philosophy is that I want to take less medication, and not more, but I was open to taking it when I felt that it was the better option.\n\nThere's no one right way, but there are many good ways that all help a lot of other people.

It\u2019s not something I ever really tell anyone personally, like it\u2019s listed on Facebook and other social media descriptions and I make allusions to my gender identity sometimes in conversations but really only my family and my boyfriend actually know as in I came out fully to them and that\u2019s all I really care about. \n\nAnd also keep in mind above all else, gender exploration is a process. No trans person got lucky enough to just wake up one day and know exactly who and what they are. We all went through the confusion and trying to learn and many of us identified one way and later found an identity that fit us better. It\u2019s okay to explore your gender and take a long time to do it. It\u2019s okay to identify one way and realize later you don\u2019t fit that as well as you thought.

Before I started my medicine (Mirtazapine 7.5 then 15mg ftr) for my anxiety, it got really bad to the point where I was having panic attacks for up to like 12 hours at a time. Sometimes I'd even wake up in the middle of the night with them. While most of the time it manifested like I couldn't breathe or was having a heart attack, sometimes I'd get the eerie feeling that I wasn't real and was dreaming everything up, or that what I thought was reality was my brain's coping mechanism when in reality something was really wrong. It got real dark and real scary. After I started taking my medicine I was super tired for a few weeks while my body adjusted, but then after that the Derealization went away for the most part. Now it only happens during extreme stress, like in situations where I really should panic.\n\nIt gets better, I promise! Good luck! IANAD but it sounds like you might be experiencing something called Derealization, which can be really terrifying. I've felt it too as a symptom of my anxiety, but it can be a symptom of depression and other issues as well.\n\nDerealization is one of the ways a brain copes with difficulties, whether it be a traumatic event, stress, chemical imbalances, you name it.\n\nFor starters, you probably feel tired from sleeping so long. Studies have shown that sleeping for longer than 8 hours causes you to wake up more tired, not less. Sleeping for long periods of time can also cause worsening symptoms of a host of mental health issues, as well as cause physical health problems.\n\nIt would be best to talk to a doctor so that they can check your thyroid for any potential issues, and refer you to mental health services, but in the mean time or if those aren't available, here are two strategies I use when I'm having anxiety attacks that might be helpful during Derealization moments too: \n\n1.) Progressive muscle relaxation.\n\nInhale and tense each muscle in your body one at a time for three seconds while holding the breath then relax and exhale, starting with your toes and moving up the body to your face. Then tense all your muscles and release while breathing out.\n\n2.) Five Senses\n\nLook around the room you are in and say five things that you can see. Describe them in detail, their shape, their color. Then feel four things around you. It could be the sheets of your bed you are sitting on, or a ball that you pick up.

At the end of the day I am but human as are you. Maybe the most important answers are not found in words but from experience. A job may aid in the spawning of happiness when combined with a productive lifestyle. However I don\u2019t believe a job in itself is fulfilling enough to provide happiness, although I will admit this is subjective. \nI\u2019m saying the career shouldn\u2019t be the defining factor in where you are at with your life. \nPart of what i\u2019m saying is building a foundational layer of fulfilment outside of your career will only enhance whatever career you choose, whether security or passion. Making security more bearable and passion more invigorating than it already seems. \nAlso you\u2019ve logically labelled them passion and security, and rightly so based on your current understanding of both, but as a 21 year old you know that life rarely works with such simplicity. You may choose security and it may not be as secure as initially predicted  through a random unforeseen unfortunate circumstance or you may choose passion and realise you weren\u2019t as passionate about it as you thought, you may even develop a disability and scuba diving becomes an impossibility. That\u2019s just some food for thought over the old internet.  \nAnd if it aids in anyway, I define happiness as a period of complete contentedness with your perspective and place in the moment. I don\u2019t believe in fleeting happiness. If happiness is fleeting then it is more likely joy or gratification over actual happiness. \nThink on this, money is a construction by humans, happiness is an intrinsic human emotion thus inevitably existed before the invention of money. In other words, money isn\u2019t integral in leading a content existence. \nMoney gives you a wider plethora of options but don\u2019t waste time waiting to obtain the chance to use these options when one can search for fulfilment and meaning now, slowly sowing the seeds in which happiness may later be reaped. \nAnother way of looking at it is that happiness/ fulfilment isn\u2019t external, it isn\u2019t an energy transferred into you through, to use your examples, \u2018voluntary work\u2019, \u2018creative pursuits\u2019 etc. It is internal. These examples and pursuits allow others to develop happiness as it connects with them internally in some way. \nDiscovering your true internal wants, needs and values can only be achieved with time and genuine deep reflection in silence, just a man and his mind. \nI hope this helps in any way, if not, then maybe only time and good old trial and error is the way Forgive my assumption but it sounds as if you are primarily basing your life off of the social construct of work. Work is important, imperative even, in sustaining a lifestyle atune to your liking. However, it should only be a supplement, if you will, to the true experience of a human lifetime. We have one chance to draw as much from each moment before the inevitable, impending death that awaits us all, work should merely be a means to an end in the face of true experience and understanding. \nScuba diving sounds like it\u2019ll bring you happiness because you are lost in your current \u2018anxiety inducing\u2019 situation. If you took the leap and pursued Scuba diving i\u2019d be willing to bet in 4-5 years time you\u2019ll be questioning your happiness again, work isn\u2019t the source from which humans derive happiness. That being said it sounds as though it will satisfy you far more than your current situation. \nI see you have researched IKIGAI which may provide you a solid foundation as I would argue happiness is found through a meaningful/purposeful life, whatever that means to you individually. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of believing there is no \u2018higher purpose\u2019 therefore there is no meaning, meaning can be derived from your everyday accomplishments and achievements, or the completion of a project years in the making etc. \nOverall I would recommend pursuing crafts and practices that may potentially, in time, provide you with a base level of happiness from which you can apply to you job, whichever one you end up choosing. You may find that once you have developed this stability through discipline and purpose, decisions about matters such as jobs are viewed with a perspective of further clarity. \nBest wishes and I hope you enjoy a prosperous existence", "bro there would be a problem if you didn\u2019t say anything. its their fine not yours tell them to step up and pay it", "You are in the camp of people who shouldn\u2019t answer the phone.

I was nice to everyone and put in the effort to learn about their personalities. It just takes practice. I can tell you now no one is perfect we are all just stumbling around trying to make the best of what we got.

There's also a guy named Bitwit who also does that kinda stuff, and you can also obviously watch Austin Evans/Linus Tech Tips. Oh. Well are you old enough to work? Cuz I can't work, so there's that.

We will have physical explanation for NDE in the near future if we don't already.  When a phenomena such as this occurs, the most likely answer is that we are missing something, NOT that all the known rules of time and space and the universe that we have determined over centuries have suddenly suspended themselves for this phenonmena.  I really doubt the the 'something' we are missing here is the necessary existence of a deity and afterlife. More likely a glitch in the way we've studied neuroscience that is yet to be resolved (or might already be resolved by now -- I am not a neuroscientist). Also that article is still trash and is def shilling their books, but w/e I looked at it because it is all you can point to.  Really I am done arguing here -- the vast majority of what we know about the world suggests that there's no deity or afterlife and that Christ certainly isn't the sole vehicle to reach such non-existent afterlife.  The burden is on the religious to prove otherwise and despite your best rhetoric, you have failed miserably. Why can\u2019t you provide a source from a peer-reviewed college journal? The fact that you can\u2019t discern scholarship from editorialist and wishful thinking reflects a sad state of affairs in our religious communities. You are gaslighting because you have no logical arguments remaining.  You have no meaningful evidence that the scientific community takes seriously, so you have to rely on psuedoscience and fringe science and social science and revisionist history to make your arguments.  And I don't have the time to tolerate that any more and thankfully I don't have to.  Goodbye and good luck Honestly if you believe anything you just typed, you are so bought into the Christian American-centric revisionist history that nothing I can say will make a difference. Maybe get out in the world. There may not be another chance. Sorry I have zero desire to read that stuff -- it is so transparently biased in favor of the religion that I can't consider it serious scholarship.  Enjoy your blind faith -- just know that you are hanging onto beliefs that have perpetuated slavery, war, genocide, and generally suppression of science and free thought for millenia. We don't know that any of that really happened -- or if you have historical evidence outside of the bible, then present it!  You are the one wasting my time now.\n\nAnd even if Christ managed to convince people he died/rose from the dead/ascended into the sky and it was somehow recorded historically accurately and without embellishment 30 years later, that doesn't mean he was in fact dead, or in fact rose, or in fact ascended. And even if he does, it STILL doesn't follow that there is necessarily a God and afterlife and he died for our sins and believing in him is the only way to get there. Whether \u201cno god = life is pointless\u201d or not, that question really has no bearing on the FACTUAL MATTER of whether or not there is a deity or an afterlife. Regardless how I answer your questions, they aren\u2019t getting me any closer to substantiating a deity or an afterlife. I am curious what evidence would move you off of your position.\nConsider this: As I mentioned earlier, if Jesus showed up and showed me heaven and hell and said that I have to be a Christian to get into Heaven, I would tell him this construct is so f\u2019d up I don\u2019t want to be a part of it. BUT, I would also admit I was wrong. Stupid way to govern a universe in my opinion.. But I would have to admit it is reality.\nHypothetically, what would move you to re-examine your beliefs? What if they found Christ\u2019s dead body and all the experts and the Pope and other religions all agreed. Would that be enough? What if a voice from the sky thundered our and everyone heard it and it was God saying Christianity is wrong and there is no afterlife? Would that be enough? Is there ANYTHING you can imagine that would shake your faith?? If not I think you are dangerously close to totalitarianism.

I find the \u2018Jesus Insurance\u2019 argument you\u2019ve presented to be extremely morally reprehensible. You are basically telling me to waste my life and compromise my values and principles for a shot at eternity. Isn\u2019t it painstakingly obvious to you how this was developed and perpetuated and promulgated to manipulate and create social compliance? See how easy it is for me to use your religion to manipulate and guilty you into continuing to waste your time on this convo?  Those websites are trash. Show me something accepted by the scientific community and peer reviewed that even marginally tends to indicate the existence of a dirty. You can\u2019t cause there isn\u2019t. And you have free will to present your evidence and I will look at it. You have my attention If you really believe your religion, that\u2019s all you are willing to do to stop me from burning in hell? And the best source you can provide is a link to a clearly biased propagandist The self delusion is real, huh? You don\u2019t have any evidence to defend that assertion :-) Lol \u201csocial utility\u201d argument. Truly the last vestiges of an indefensible religion Lol I never said I was an expert. I am not committed to a worldview so I am glad to admit when I am wrong. I was generalizing \u2014 but ok whatever they were written 30 years after? So what? Doesn\u2019t prove any of your assertions. You have to buy into the doctrine of biblical inerrancy for any of it to make sense, and any adult dumb enough to not see these for what they are \u2014 man made manuscripts \u2014 might deserve to waste their their life waiting for the next one, honestly. I think the true arrogance is thinking you can ascertain the will of an almighty deity from ancient texts created long before science or even basic concepts of human rights. Atheists have repeatedly exposed inaccuracies and inconsistencies \u2014 you know as well as I do that this is not a fact based analysis, but an emotional perpetuation that people subscribe to. ....the gospels were written 100 or more years after Christ died and were the result of passed-down oral tradition.  I was really hoping you'd have a decent argument -- as it is you who is trying to prove your assertion. \n\nAs to my age, I am pretty confident that I will never 'come back to the Church' -- Christ himself could show up and tell me I'm going to hell. and I'd respond that the entire construct is so fucked that I would actually prefer to burn in hell.\n\nPerhaps people come back to the church because they fear impending death, which feels much more real and tangible as we get older, so they come to cope and get their 'Jesus insurance'.  Either way it doesn't say anything about the validity of the matter.  But frankly I don't expect anyone who subscribes to such a narrow worldview to give sufficient credence to formal logic. This certainly doesn't 'prove his divinity'.  How do you know hundreds of people saw him? Can you offer source evidence for your proposition? Nor do I know why my age has any bearing on the topic, but I am 32. Fascinating \u2014 I was raised in strict Christian household and agnosticism/atheism became the obvious \u2018most correct answer\u2019 to me. \n\nYou said above,  \u201cI hope to get an eternity with God and thus the perfect life.\u201d  Are you conceding, then, that there is zero verifiable evidence for the traditional Christian construct of \u2018need a Jesus co-sign to get into heaven\u2019?

You're a very good friend for wanting to protect him. I would definitely try to warn him and tell him to take care of himself first, maybe by going to therapy. Whatever her problems may be, he cannot let her control his life like that. \nIf he's that committed to the relationship, he should at least make sure that she's is aware of her behaviour and that she's trying to work on it. If she isn't aware of her toxic behaviour at all, if she doesn't feel guilty about it and isn't working on it, he should think about what he's gaining from this relationship.\n\nI think the best approach is to get him to tell you about the relationship. Ask him about the problems. How do these situations start and when do they escalate. Maybe this will make him spot the problem or come up with solutions himself. Maybe he could tell her that he really wants to make it work with her, but that he cannot take the threats any longer.; calmly explain that this just isn't okay and that he will distance himself for a while (like an hour or something) to get some breathing room when she crosses a line, for the sake of his own mental health.

Also, I'm sure your bf loves you for more than for your positive nature- I feel like you're an amazing, thoughtful person, so I'm certain people appreciate you a lot. \n\nTo circle back to your question: \nI don't think nobody wants to be with a sad person: What actually is going on is that nobody wants to see the person they're with sad. I personally know how it feels to be excluded from emotional issues. It doesn't feel good. So...talking usually helps. And if you don't feel comfortable doing so, I strongly suggest journaling. Just somehow make sure you're not completely alone with your thoughts and worries...open up, even if it's just to a few pages of paper.\n\nI hope this somehow helped you, or at least made you feel distracted for a little while. I wish you the best and if you ever feel like talking- I somehow find it easier ranting to a stranger than to someone I personally know- feel free to PM me and I'll reply as soon as I can.\n\nLove from Germany &lt;3", "IT guy too here (not a particularly good one) but that\u2019s a super easy thing to fix man lol. 20 minutes tops for anyone with basic IT \u201cknowledge\u201d.

I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16. Some days are good. Some are bad. Most are just okay. I dont think you are being overdramatic. Depression effects a lot of things and arguing with your friends could be a part of your depression.  Also people grow apart.  I am much older than you and I don't really have any of the same friends I did when I was 17. Im Facebook friends with a lot of people from high school but not so much in real life. I say this just to let you know that things change and people change. Doesn't mean any of you are right or wrong. The main thing is you need to take care of you.

Which is why limiting that is a helpful start.\n\nAfter that, finding and admiring random beauty. Here's where individual uniqueness comes in. An easy one for some might be taking a moment to catch a glimpse of the assorted colors in a sunset, a random flower, tree. It could be the bird that just landed outside your window. Seeing and performing random acts of kindness. As devastating as natural disasters are, you see love and kindness from strangers coming together to rescue, rebuild, and help wholeheartedly with no expectation of fame or fortune, because its the right thing to do and that might be the something they could contribute. Those are the real life stories and examples that get seldom air time if any in most cases.\n\nIt doesn't have to be grand or extraordinary, often times the smallest gestures carry the most weight. Holding a door for someone, saying good morning, letting someone merge in traffic, or pull out when traffic is heavy, using a turn signal. Please and thank you go a long way. Someone could be having a bad day and a kind acknowledgment might be just the thing they needed. \n\nWhen you start seeing and noticing these things more and more, you'll soon realize the world just might not be as bad as its made out to be. There's a saying I heard that may help bring comfort. \"No one can do everything, but everyone can do something\". And that something will have to be up to every individual, in their own way.

They're not easy to get over, but they are not things that should define how date people or get jealous.

It makes it easier to get over someone you regularly meet if you signal that you have other romantic interests as was the case with me. It's very tough when you have someone on your mind, but it makes the first thing I said easier to accept.  But it helps signal to Markus that you are genuinely trying to get over him and gives him and Winter that security.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nTLDR: You can tell him, but you won't get over him and it can make things awkward.

If I was in your shoes you know what I would do? I would let her go. If she doesn't want to be a respectful daughter then let her go and take the time and spend it on you. Stop forcing her to talk to you, and all this parties and shopping and lunches?? You are buying her affection, and even worse she doesn't see it for what it is; you care and you want to give her what you didn't have with your mom but if she thinks so low of you she is using you for everything she can get from you and that's not a nice thing to do to her own mother. You think if you stand up for your self they won't love you? The only people who would think that are people that don't matter. YOU know you go above and beyond for her, that's all that matters. She will NEVER consider your feeling until you stop being stepped on and stand up for yourself. And this excuse \"Oh it's her age, that's what girls do\" is bullshit. She lashed out at you for saying no?? Has she never been told no before?? Can you imagine what she will be like if she throws a tantrum at being told no as an adult? Come on, let's be honest, your daughter is spoiled and it's starting to become her character. \n\nPlease, let her go a little. Back off and let her see the way she treated you hurt you and that's not okay. If she thinks she don't need you, well, then stop doing things for her. She'll always be your daughter and you'll always be her mom and that won't change. Take some time and take care of you. Maybe go out with some friends, do a few things you like to do??

If she is truly your best friend, she will be concerned if you are hurt.  I mostly want to point out that some people are not very good at handling situations like this.  As bad as it sounds, they become awkward when someone they know suffers something bad or traumatic because they don't know how to respond.  I'm sure a lot of people find it a bit difficult to reach out when someone has been hurt, but in some people it's more extreme.  I know this because I am (or used to be) one of those people.  When I was in college my best friend had a stroke and went to the hospital.  I found out from my mom, who found out from his stepmom.  I thought that because my friend didn't tell me himself, he must not want people to know.  So I didn't tell my other friends, despite all of us being very good friends.  I didn't stop and think that maybe he was embarrassed, or didn't want to make everything about him, which in hindsight is exactly why he didn't tell me, because he is a very selfless person.  I totally should have told my friends about it, and asked them all to go visit him with me, but I didn't say anything.  When they found out, they couldn't understand why I didn't say anything.  Basically, the situation really threw me and upset me and I responded irrationally.  I'm not saying that's what happened with your friend, but it's a possibility.  If I were you, I would just be straight with her and tell her you feel hurt that she hasn't asked about your accident.  Your reaction is completely reasonable and there's nothing wrong with you reaching out and telling her how you feel.  It doesn't have to be in an accusatory way, just tell her you feel hurt and why.", "I\u2019d ask your doctor, as I\u2019m sure only sorta sure on how the body works, but yeah I mean, why not experiment, see what works for you!

Outstanding debt should be considered in the fixed item because you need to pay off. \n\nAn example is :  if you make 1000 each month.

On the other hand, it\u2019s good to be introduced to any business area you enter at a younger age, and it\u2019s also good to have some notion of how to handle your own money. So to conclude I would say if you really want to get a job, wait till you\u2019re 16 and until then, find what jobs accept people this age and train in how to be efficient on that job, also, I would recommend that you don\u2019t spend all your money on pcs and games and so on, as much as I know it\u2019s tempting hehe. Try to have some notion on how much you spend to have some money left at the end of the month in any emergency.

However, schools will regardless look to see whether or not you took difficult courses in order to judge your GPA. If you plan on applying to a high ranking school like Stanford or Harvard, taking AP definitely helps, and may even be necessary to get in.

Also we have other dogs and we wanted to give them a chance to say good bye. \n\nSo the vet comes over, asks us a bunch of questions about the paw print thing and payment and what we wanted to do with her remains. They injected her with a sedative. The vet said it should take about five minutes. She relaxed almost immediately. The vet said that means they're ready to go. Vet said to take as long as we need and when we were ready they'd start. We kissed her head and sobbed and told her she's good. They shaved a part of her leg. Then they injected one fluid then another. Then she was just gone. It wasn't exactly like watching her go to sleep. It was like I could feel her absence? The vet and the assistant went out to get the gurney thing. More sobbing. I held her like a baby. Our pit bull stayed and watched the whole thing. She growled at the vet the entire time. Our basset mix sat outside (I think she thought she was going to get a thermometer up her butt). I called my little dog inside and she sniffed her head. It was weird.

But you need to own your behavior.", "Sorry if I assumed too much and for a delayed response. Base on your post, I thought you meant you had many male friends but have trouble making any female friends. I think that\u2019s why some people responded so negatively to your post because whenever someone can\u2019t get along with half of the population (women), it\u2019s usually not the 50% of the world\u2019s population\u2019s fault. Rather, it\u2019s how you\u2019re interacting with them. But from your reply, it sounds like you\u2019re just having a problem making any friends, not just female friends then. \n\nI think I can relate to you due to also being a shy girl who didn\u2019t naturally make friends easily. I realized at one point lots of my friends were guys simply because they pursued me for \u201cfriendship\u201d even though they probably wanted something more. They forgave my awkwardness and my shyness as well as my general lack of social graces so I didn\u2019t even realize I had issues till I tried to make friends with girls and found it really difficult. Only then did I fully realize that I was missing an important skill to make friends with other people without them having an agenda. I never got to be friends with people I really wanted to befriend because I never practiced how to do that. \n\nYou\u2019re right that I don\u2019t know your story. You sound chill but also maybe a bit shy deep down and it sounds like you exude some sexual energy that would make guys LOVE to be your friend but honestly as a girl, it would make lots of girls hesitate to be your friend. You don\u2019t have to change yourself completely but it is definitely a bit harder to find girls who would be drawn to a very sexual energy from a female friend. If it\u2019s important part of your identity, then you gotta put yourself out there and keep meeting people till you find others like yourself. If you like to experiment a bit, you can try different ways to approach girls and to form friendships and see which way you would prefer.  You sound like an open and friendly person so I\u2019m sure you would figure it out! In a year\u2019s time, you\u2019ll look back and see how much you grown!\n\nHope this was helpful! If not, at least it was somewhat therapeutic for me to reflect on my past experiences and share what I learned :p Not necessarily the case. I think it can also be because making friends with a guy who\u2019s attracted to you requires minimal effort on your part because the guy would make way more effort to be friendly to you simply because you\u2019re attractive to them. To other women, you gotta work at the friendship which is hard to do if you\u2019re surrounded by easy and often unequal friendships with guys who just wanna hang out with you cuz your attractive.\n\nFrankly being friends with guys who\u2019re low key after you is making friends on easy mode. If you always relied on having guy friends who will be super forgiving of you being a bit lazy/selfish/boring/weird/mean/etc simply because they\u2019re hoping if they can be your boyfriend one day, it can be tough to develop the skills to make friends. This is fine as long as there are guys who find you attractive and are willing to be extra friendly to you because you are attractive, but you gotta think of that as a temporary and bonus power and learn how to make friends as a skill too. \n\nOP you sound fairly chill in your responses so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being mean to other girls. Maybe just a bit accustomed to one-sided friendships? It sounds like guys are usually initiating these friendships because you mentioned it can be hard to put yourself out there to make friends. As a fellow shy girl myself, it is super easy to be friends with guys because they would make effort to talk to me, laugh at my jokes, etc. But with female friends, I have to try to make them. I have to invite people over, initiate plans, be the type of friend I\u2019d like to have. \n\nI have made great female friends this way and of course I\u2019m not saying do all the work but it seems fair to do roughly half of the planning? Yeah it\u2019s more work but the friendships are worth it because the guy friends who\u2019re low key after you can get mad if you end things with your bf and don\u2019t date them. Or there are just these expectations that makes things awkward. \n\nPlus it makes me wonder if they truly like hanging out with me or they just wanna date me and that\u2019s the only reason they\u2019re laughing at my jokes. Nothing like that with my female friends. Only reason we hang out is because we love hanging out and have fun.

Get that tattoo and be proud of the hard work you put in to saving yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love you and I'm so glad you're doing better!!", "You've been dating **one month** and you already want to cheat on the guy because you're incompatible with affection levels?

Ah yeah, it be like that sometimes Yeah,same here, even my mother has argued with him few times over this and it still doesn't stop him. I guess we can only wait till we move out lol  I'm same age and my father has been doing this to me since I was like 13. I always tell him to stop coz it's just fucking weird but he doesn't care. Didn't know that someone else had the same problem. Maybe it's some kind of perverted mindset that some father's get lol.", "&gt; broken ass-algorithm\n\n***\n\n^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot.

Weddings are overrated sometimes anyways I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. I helped my sister in law plan her wedding and I know how stressful and expensive it can be. Do you have the receipt for the deposit and contact information for the person you paid it to? I know your family is out of the question but have you thought about getting help from friends? I know this is crazy but maybe cook/bake some of the items on your own", "Damned!  There\u2019s always that one in every crowd.", "Yeah that's probably what it is then.  He's just probably really hurt by the way he was treated by her.  It takes time to heal from things like that. It can be.  It depends on the situation.  I did this a lot when my ex broke up with me, but it was cause he did it out of the blue and gave me no closure at all.  It could be that he genuinely isn't over her.  I would point it out to him bluntly.  He may not be aware of how it is coming off to you", "Or turning it off and on again?", "Along with everyone else advice here I would like to add this....\n\nIs there a way for you to check out what she is watching on youtube and what she is looking at on the internet? If you do happen to find something you don't like DO NOT bring it up to her. You have to figure out a different way to approach the subject. \n\nOnce kids know you know what they are doing on the internet they will outsmart you quickly and learn how to hide their stuff better.  \n\nAlso maybe try getting her some books for tween/teens on building character. There are also flash cards and board game for this too. They are a great way to start bringing up stuff she doesn't want to talk about but, gives her emotional tools anyway. literally, just google teen character building game/book/etc. \n\nIf it gets worse the best thing is to take her to volunteer at places like homeless woman's shelters. Nothing is more humbling but, I wouldn't until she is a little older (14/15) if t's still an issue.", "How did you discover it? What were your symptoms?", "You say you got depression and anxiety, I wonder if you get enough sleep? As someone who has had and still occasionally has depression &amp; anxiety bouts, my sleeping can be awful and after a few days of less than 7-8 hours, I start to get brain fog and forgetfulness.\n\nSevere Lack of sleep especially like say only 2-3hrs or less also has similar effects to being drunk. Currently I only had 3hrs sleep myself last night but intend to fix that later with some good early nights Sleep. Also I rely on energy drinks on those days were i slept less just to get me through the day but unfortunately become addicted to them because of the caffeine.\n\nMake sure you get a quite few days of full 7-8hrs and you\u2019ll start to feel like you remember stuff well again.\n\nIf not and your sleeping okay , the stress &amp; anxiety &amp; certainly depression can be part of the reason.\n\nAlso if the sleeping advice doesn\u2019t work because you sleep fine you may wanna seek out professional medical help", "Seconded. I see you said you had a therapist. Please do see her again.\n\nI know it\u2019s frustrating when the meds don\u2019t work, but keep on it and you\u2019ll find something that works, I promise.\n\nYou feel like talking about it?", "Do you know what kind of child pornography he was charged with? Law can be kind of difficult, if he posses pictures of himself or maybe a girlfriend, its still considered child pornography. Just food for thought. If it was actual children pornography he had possession of, its probably not safe to let him be around your \"future children\" alone. Under supervision, I'm sure he wouldn't do anything or act on it. Very rarely do underage, convicted child predators continue this behavior. Its normally not seen in men until they are in their late 30s-40s. But because he was so young, there are a lot of risk factors that could have contributed to it. I'm not trying to make excuses for what he did and ultimately it will be your choice to make.\n\nSource: I work in Criminal Justice", "Stay calm. Stay casual. Don't pressure anyone into feeling...

I don't just mean about that, I mean about a lot of things.\n\nPersonally I learned not to let the little things, or things I can't control bother me too much. Is frustration and stress still a thing? Sure, but I try to stay mindful and remind myself that you can't fix everyone's mistakes, or change their intelligence.

If you\u2019re only one year in, I guess you can take the hit if you want. It sounds from your posts that you\u2019d rather be training to do something else. No problem. I just wanted to remind you that it\u2019s your life and your choice. You\u2019re not a coward or anything like that. Some people are just more comfortable being agreeable than disagreeable. If you were always disagreeable, everyone would probably think, \u201cWhat an ass,\u201d or, \u201cThat person is too direct.\u201d \ud83d\ude05 The idea of you not doing what you want to do with your life because your parents might turn their noses up at it is infuriating.

That being said, completing college is the best thing to do because you can do it at a slow pace and it\u2019ll help you make the money necessary to live. I agree with those who are saying to take a break. That makes the most sense. Dropping out makes little sense, since you\u2019re already so far along.
